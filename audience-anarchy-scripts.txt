TRAINER: Oh yeah, I saw that on the news. So tragic.
TRAINER: I'm sorry for your loss.
OWNER: Thank you. But it was worth it for the CUPCAKE.
WOMAN: (Stick head in through door) Your POODLE is in my bedroom!
WOMAN: Come get your out of control dog for crying out loud!
WOMAN: (Sneeze) Achoo! (Leave)
TRAINER: Meh, he'll be fine. My POODLE is very graceful.
OWNER: I can't look at another CUPCAKE without thinking of my husband Dave.
(70s music)
OWNER: (Looking at TRAINER flirtatiously) But you're not a CUPCAKE...
TRAINER: Are you saying you like to look at me?
OWNER: Do you work out?
TRAINER: I walk my dog while doing STRENUOUS ACTIVITY.

Meanwhile OWNER: (Exit stage left)
DOG: Woof woof! (Pick up some MAGAZINES and follow the TRAINER, exit stage left)
(Music stops)
CAT: (Lonely meow) Mow
WOMAN: Aww, poor kitty. Your name was MITTENS, right? (Offering the cat a snack) Do you want some SNACK?
CAT: Mow (Pee on the floor)
Meanwhile WOMAN: (Reacting to CAT peeing on carpet) No! Not the clean floor! Bad kitty! Bad MITTENS! Shoo!
WOMAN: (Reacting to CAT peeing on carpet) No! Not the clean floor! Bad kitty! Bad MITTENS! Shoo!
Meanwhile CAT: (Hiss and run away, exit stage left) Hiss! Meow!

COWBOY: It reminds me of that one time I wrangled a cow that done got its BODY PART blown off by a FRENCH WEAPON.
COWBOY: But listen here.
COWBOY: It is my humble belief that simpler is always better.

COWBOY: But I beg you to reconsider.
COWBOY: (Point at ALIEN) But them there is the wrong kind of Alien.
COWBOY: One time, Aliens just like flew over my Uncle Bob's farm and stole his cows and does God knows what to them.

COWBOY: but I reckon I’m not feeling too confident about handing our nation's reins to a varmint like that (Point at ALIEN)...
COWBOY: whose idea of a good time is suckin' the BODY PART off of some poor, unsuspecting cow.
COWBOY: Also, you should vote for me because I like GUN.

Applause
MODERATOR: Interesting points on both sides. However, we are almost out of time.
MODERATOR: Mr. Cletus Williams, do you have any closing remarks?
USA Anthem Music
COWBOY: Well folks, the choice is clear. A vote for me is a vote for good old-fashioned American values, like cows, and CAPITALISM.
COWBOY: I stand for guns, freedom, guns, CAPITALISM, and not getting our BODY PARTS eaten by extraterrestrial forces.
COWBOY: However, I do concede that the love between brother and sister is strong.
COWBOY: But the love between a man and his GUN is stronger.
COWBOY: Your honor, I rest my case.
Music stops
Applause
MODERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Williams. XN-74, your closing remarks?
USA Anthem Music
ALIEN: Our ultimate goal is not destruction, but construction.
ALIEN: From the plasma-scorched ashes of this miserable sphere of rock you call "Earth", we will rebuild a new society,
ALIEN: Built on the slave labor of humans, and fueled by INTERNAL ORGAN burgers...
ALIEN: which is what we call cow hamburgers made from the INTERNAL ORGAN of humans.
ALIEN: I mean cows! I meant to say the INTERNAL ORGAN of cows.
ALIEN: They are extremely delicious and will be given to all the "Good" humans who work hard and don't incite an uprising against ZORTRON.
ALIEN: The "bad" humans will be put to work in the burger factory.
ALIEN: (Point at audience) Puny Earthlings! Look under your chairs! Everyone gets a free MASSAGE DEVICE!

DETECTIVE: (Looking out the window) It's late one November night.
DETECTIVE: (Walk up to audience) The cigarette smoke swirls around my apartment like the puzzles swim around my mind.
DETECTIVE: I'm knee-deep in a labyrinth of dead ends and unanswered questions.
DETECTIVE: Who exactly was the Big Apple Burglar?
DETECTIVE: Why do they steal priceless jewels and leave little notes behind?
DETECTIVE: I had a hunch that the burglar was actually a SNAKE wearing a burglar costume, but... that trail went cold.
DETECTIVE: Imagine that. A SNAKE wearing a cute little burglar costume.
DETECTIVE: (Smoke cigarette, gag, cough) Makes me sick to my stomach.
Knocking on door
DETECTIVE: (Calling out) Who's there?
PIZZA GUY: Pizza delivery.
DETECTIVE: Come on... the door's open.
PIZZA GUY: (Enter) Here's your personal pan pizza, sir. Extra TOPPING.
Noir music 2
DETECTIVE: (Step forward and speak to audience again) He walked into my office wearing a goofy Pizza delivery outfit.
DETECTIVE: And LEGS like CHOPSTICKS that went... ALL the way up.
DETECTIVE: They say crime is like a big, juicy pizza, overflowing with TOPPING.
DETECTIVE: Except instead of pizza, it's New York City.
DETECTIVE: And instead of TOPPING, it's crime.
DETECTIVE: And the cheese? That's the RATS.
DETECTIVE: But something was off about this personal pan pizza with extra TOPPING... I could feel it.
DETECTIVE: (Return to scene, talk to PIZZA GUY) How much do I owe you?
PIZZA GUY: That will be 15 dollars.
DETECTIVE: (Taking money out of wallet) Here, kid. Keep the change.
PIZZA GUY: Thanks, have a nice day (Begin to move toward the door)
PIZZA GUY: (Remembering something) Say, detective... you wouldn't happen to have any JEWELS laying around the office, would you?
DETECTIVE: JEWELS? Kid, don't get me started on JEWELS. (Bite into a slice of pizza)
DETECTIVE: (Talk with mouth full) I'm hot on the case of the Big Apply Burglar, and all that dastardly thief does is steal JEWELS.
DETECTIVE: Except the trail's gone cold... (Spit out the pizza) Just like this pizza.
DETECTIVE: Say, why'd it take so long for you to get here? This pizza is stone cold like MY MOTHER.
PIZZA GUY: Sorry, detective. I had to take a quick, uh, "detour" on the way over.
PIZZA GUY: ... at the gun store. (Take out a gun and point it at the detective)
Vine boom
Noir music 3
DETECTIVE: (Gasp) You. You're the Big Apple Burglar!
PIZZA GUY: Finally figured it out, eh, detective?
DETECTIVE: (Step forward and speak to audience again) It all made sense now.
DETECTIVE: The pizza boxes we found at the crime scene. The TOPPING on the victim's bodies.
DETECTIVE: It was right under my nose the entire time.
DETECTIVE: But I wasn't about to let this ADJECTIVE-NOSE little creep get away this time...
DETECTIVE: and besides... I had something the thief wanted that was more valuable than priceless JEWELS.
PIZZA GUY: (To DETECTIVE) You should have put assembled all the slices of this mystery sooner, detective.
PIZZA GUY: Now, I'm the one who's going to leave YOU a fat tip...
PIZZA GUY: The tip of my bullet in your chest.
DETECTIVE: Oh, but Pizza guy... or should I say, "Big Apple Burglar"... I have some information that will interest you very much.
PIZZA GUY: Oh yeah? Nice try. Stop stalling for time.
PIZZA GUY: I'm going to silence you like I silence the notifications on my phone when my wife tries to call me about IMPORTANT BUSINESS.
PIZZA GUY: Besides, the only thing I care about is stealing all of the JEWELS in this city...
DETECTIVE: ... so that you can buy your SNAKE back from the crime boss, Big KAHUNA Frankie?
Noir music 2
PIZZA GUY: (Lowering gun) H-how do you know about that?
PIZZA GUY: How do you kn ow that Big KAHUNA Frankie, New York City's seventh-biggest crime boss, is holding my SNAKE hostage?
DETECTIVE: (Smoking) It wasn't easy to find that out, even for a detective like me.
DETECTIVE: I had to BRIBE a lot of guys.
DETECTIVE: What can I say... if you follow the trail of pizza, and BRIBE enough guys... that's classic detective work.
DETECTIVE: I may not agree with your methods, and I don't like your ADJECTIVE NOSE, but it seems like I don't have a much of a choice, now, do I?
PIZZA GUY: Listen, man. If you help me get my SNAKE back from Big KAHUNA Frankie, I'll return all the JEWELS. I swear it.
PIZZA GUY: I don't even like JEWELS. I just like pizza.... and murder.
DETECTIVE: Seems like you and me have more alike than I thought.
DETECTIVE: (Taking hat and coat from rack) Let's hit the road. If the cops ask any questions... I'll BRIBE them. (Leave)

Applause
GAMER: (Wave to audience) What's boppin, chat?
MODERATOR: And running independently, billionaire owner of the HoneyBear incorporated and the HoneyBear chocolate factory, John Bear.
Applause
JOHN: (Wave to audience) Ladies and gentlemen, is it my sweet, sweet pleasure to be here... or should I say, "BEE" here!
JOHN: Get it? Because I own a Honey company? (Laugh maniacally)
JOHN: Actually, HoneyBear Incorporated makes many candy products other than Honey. But that's neither here nor there--
JOHN: (Grandly) Let the tournament commence!
MODERATOR: Excuse me, sir.
MODERATOR: You may be the owner of the largest mega-corporation in the world,
MODERATOR: Which brings billions of pounds of delicious HONEY (and other candy products) to the children of the world,
MODERATOR: But in this debate room-- it is I, who am God.
JOHN: Tut tut, mister moderator! Don't forget who owns you... and your HOME!
MODERATOR: (Slightly scared) That might be so, but this is supposed to be a neutral setting for debate... and I am here to oversee it...
Meanwhile JOHN: (Mockingly imitate the MODERATOR's words)
JOHN: I OWN YOU!
Meanwhile MODERATOR: (Get scared) Ahh!
MODERATOR: (Scared, shaking) Um, y-yes, sorry, your candy-excellency.
MODERATOR: (Clearing throat) Ahem... Anyway... um...
JOHN: (Reminding) "Our first question is about candy..."
MODERATOR: Yes, yes, our first question is about candy.
MODERATOR: (Whispering to JOHN) Should I start with you, my lord?
JOHN: (Whispering to MODERATOR) No, it's fine, let "them" go first.
JOHN: (Whispering to MODERATOR) Then I will CRUSH them like a piece of hard candy beneath my feet.
MODERATOR: (To GAMER) XXSHADOWNINJAXX, what is your opinion on candy?
MODERATOR: Specifically, will you allow John Bear to distribute free candy to all the children of the nation?
USA anthem music
GAMER: (To audience) People of the United States of America... we have suffered too long at the hands of my opponent, John Bear, and his reign of corporate tyranny.
GAMER: Yes, he may be distributing free candy laced with ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE to the children of the world.
GAMER: But is all that ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE really free?
GAMER: If we were truly "free", we would be able to get our ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE from any ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE dealer we want.
GAMER: But I ask you, where are all the ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE dealers?
GAMER: What happened to them? One day, they were all just mysteriously... gone?
GAMER: If you ask me, that's a little sus.
GAMER: Now, I might just be an ordinary FORTNITE gamer. With the gamer tag XXSHADOWNINJAXX.
GAMER: But tonight, my cause is greater than any Victory Royale.
Gameshow buzzer
JOHN: Objection! Shut it down. FORTNITE was not on the approved list of topics for tonight's debate.
JOHN: Why not change the subject and talk about my newest line of LOLLIPOPS?
MODERATOR: Sure, let's take a quick break to talk about tonight's debate's sponsor, HoneyBear Incoporated, and their new product, ADJECTIVE LOLLIPOPS.
Badass music 1
JOHN: That's right, from the same lovable company that brought you SQUIGGLY SUCKERS,
JOHN: which also happens to be the same company that 90% of America works for and makes 90% of all products,
JOHN: comes a brand new candy! It's called ADJECTIVE LOLLIPOPS!
MODERATOR: Wow! I can't wait to try one of those LOLLIPOPS! I bet they're super ADJECTIVE!

JOHN: It's gonna tickle your little taste buds just right!

Peaceful fantasy music
WIZARD: Greetings, DEVOURER OF CHAOS, Sorcerer of the Ninth Realm.
SORCERER: Salutations, uh... I'm sorry, what was your name again? I'm terrible with names.
WIZARD: MERLIN. My name is MERLIN. We attended magic school together for like... 5 years.
SORCERER: Ah, PigFarts university. I remember it like it was a century ago.
WIZARD: Ha! I believe it was two centuries ago!
SORCERER: (Laughing) Who's counting! Haha!
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Laughing together)
SORCERER: Hey, can I ask you something? You ever turn your staff into a snake just for fun?
WIZARD: Just for fun? I guess you can say that. WINK! (Wink at SORCERER)
Alien teleport, Magic sound, Teleport HUMAN to CENTER STAGE
HUMAN: (Surprised, confused!) Wha--What happened? (Look around) Where am I?
HUMAN: (Thinking hard) The last thing I remember was... driving through a FRANCHISE drive-through?
HUMAN: (Looking around) And now I'm in a fantasy world full of... Wizards?
WIZARD: Greetings, good fellow! I am MERLIN, wizard of this realm.
SORCERER: And I am DEVOURER OF CHAOS, Sorcerer of the Ninth Realm.
HUMAN: I must have been Isekai-ed into a completely different universe!
HUMAN: I mean uh... "realm."
HUMAN: (Pointing) And is that a... MUSHROOM in the distance?
SORCERER: (Looking over shoulder) Oh yeah, the MUSHROOM. We have plenty of those here.
WIZARD: You're not from this realm, are you, stranger?
SORCERER: Does your world not have MUSHROOM?
HUMAN: No. But we do have FRANCHISE.
SORCERER: (Struggling to pronounce word) ...FRANCHISE? What manner of sorcery is that?
WIZARD: I think I know a spell called "Abra-ka-FRANCHISE".
SORCERER: Do you want to try it?
WIZARD: Couldn't hurt.
WIZARD: (Channeling a magical incantation) Abra-ka-FRANCHISE!
Meanwhile SORCERER: (Channeling a magical incantation) Abra-ka-FRANCHISE!
Thunder, Magic sound
Peaceful fantasy music
SORCERER: (Surprised) Oh! That's silly. (Feeling mouth) It turned my teeth into MATERIAL.
WIZARD: Fascinating! I shall write this down in my scroll. (Pull out a scroll and write in it)
HUMAN: Hmm, I was driving my VEHICLE through the FRANCHISE drive-through...
HUMAN: Have you wizards seen my VEHICLE come out of some kind of portal, or rift, or something?
WIZARD: VEHICLE? Indeed! A strange monstrosity labeled "VEHICLE" manifested itself in the forest just hours ago.
HUMAN: Where can I find it? Perhaps I can use it to return to my world.
WIZARD: Good luck with that. We saw a gang of goblins loot that VEHICLE almost immediately.
SORCERER: Looked like they were trying to convert it into some kind of battle-wagon tricked out with enchanted VEHICLE armor.
WIZARD: They're still working on it but believe me, so far, it looks pretty sick.
HUMAN: Darn. How am I going to get back to my Earth, now?
WIZARD: Earth? Why, you're standing on it, dear, boy! Ha! (Laugh to self)
SORCERER: (Laughing together) This poor chap doesn't even know the four elements of which our realm is composed! What a fool! Ha ha ha!
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Laugh together, mocking the HUMAN)
HUMAN: (Not amused) I do happen to know the elements, Wizards. In fact, I'm a chemistry student.
HUMAN: And on my planet, which is called EARTH, we have 118 elements.
SORCERER: Oh yeah? Name every element.
HUMAN: Okay. Uh, Hydrogen... Helium...
WIZARD: (Breaking out in laughter) "Helium!" Ha! You're definitely making that up.
Meanwhile SORCERER: (Break out in laughter and point at the HUMAN mockingly)
SORCERER: Ha! Every knows the four elements are Earth, Water, Fire, and ELEMENT!
HUMAN: You know what, I don't need this. I'm gonna go find a way back home.
SORCERER: Okay, chump! Good luck finding your way out of this forest with all the "CREATUREs" lurking about!
WIZARD: (Quietly to SORCERER) Shh, don't give him any hints.
HUMAN: You Wizards are real jerks (Start to leave, but hesitate) Wait... did you say CREATURE?
SORCERER: Why yes, there are CREATURE all throughout these woods!
SORCERER: Hiding behind every MUSHROOM, in fact!
HUMAN: Why do you say it like that? Should I be worried about these CREATUREs?
SORCERER: (Coy) I don't know... should you?
HUMAN: Well, when you say it like that, I'm not so sure I want to go venturing off without some protection...
HUMAN: Are you guys going to help me or what?
WIZARD: (Walk up to Human) You know, I feel bad for you, Human.
WIZARD: With your flimsy little arms and fragile BODY PART (Fiddle with HUMAN's BODY PART)
HUMAN: What's wrong with my BODY PART?
WIZARD: Allow me to cast a spell of moderate protection.
SORCERER: Yeah, that's fair. If you die, who will we mock for our amusement?
HUMAN: (Pondering) I've never been under a magic spell before.
HUMAN: Unless you count listening to SONG nonstop when I was in high school.
WIZARD: What a coincidence. That's exactly the incantation to this spell.
SORCERER: (Gather near the human) Let's begin the spell. Ready, MERLIN?
WIZARD: Ready, DEVOURER OF CHAOS.
WIZARD: (Chanting, waving arms around) SONG, SONG, SONG

Jazz music 1
JACOB: (Fiddling in kitchen) Did you eat all the PIZZA ROLLS?
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Sitting on couch playing on phone)
TREVOR: (Sitting on couch playing on phone) No way. I didn't eat what was left of your delicious PIZZA ROLLS.
JACOB: Are you sure? I could have sworn there were at least several PIZZA ROLLS left.
TREVOR: (Sitting on couch) Yeah yeah whatever. Hey man. Check out this pic. (Hold out cellphone)
Meanwhile JACOB: (Do stuff in the kicthen)
JACOB: (Shielding eyes, looking away) Oh no. Nope. Not falling for that again.
JACOB: (Wagging finger at TREVOR) Nuh uh
TREVOR: What? (Wiggle phone, invitingly) Come on, It's a funny pic, check this out.
JACOB: Last time you wanted to show me a so-called "funny pic", it was a picture of TERRIBLE THING.
TREVOR: Okay, I admin. That was highly uncool of me. Even if it was a little funny.
TREVOR: But I promise, this isn't like that. C'mon, check out this pic. It's worth it.
JACOB: (Disbelief) Oh yeah? What's it a picture of, then?
TREVOR: (Holding out phone and not even looking at it) It's... a picture of my PETANIMAL.
TREVOR: (Unconvincingly) It's... a meme of my PETANIMAL, actually!
JACOB: (Disbelief) What does this "Meme" say? What's the text on it?
TREVOR: I'm not gonna spoil it by reading it out loud. You have to see for yourself. That's the whole point.
JACOB: No! Before I commit to engaging with that meme, I need definitive proof that it's not a picture of TERRIBLE THING.
JACOB: Or anything else of that nature.
MARTHA: (Enter) What's all this commotion? And are there any PIZZA ROLLS left?
TREVOR: (To MARTHA) Hey, Martha. Check out this pic on my phone. (Hold out phone)
Meanwhile MARTHA: (Don't look at the phone just yet)
JACOB: (Urgently) DO NOT do it!
MARTHA: What's the matter? Why can't I just look at that pic?
JACOB: (Shielding MARTHA, whispering to her) It's a prank, it's probably a picture of HORRIBLE THING or something like that.
JACOB: Don't encourage this. Just ignore it. Save yourself. You're still pure. You can get away.
TREVOR: Don't listen to Jacob. He's just hangry for PIZZA ROLLS.
Meanwhile JACOB: (Gesture for MARTHA to leave the room)
TREVOR: (Pointing to phone) This is just a meme of my PETANIMAL. That's all. It's pretty funny.
TREVOR: So instead of questioning my motivations, why don't you check it out yourself? (Hold out phone)
JACOB: Martha, for the love of PIZZA ROLLS, if you value your eyeballs, don't look at that PETANIMAL meme.
MARTHA: You guys have some kind of problem you need to work out. I'm not sure I want to get involved.
JACOB: Thank you!
TREVOR: You know what? Don't look at this meme of my PETANIMAL.
TREVOR: It's not like I put a lot of time and effort into it.
TREVOR: Studying the greatest memes and learning from them to craft the perfect, witty, ironic meme.
TREVOR: Raising a PETANIMAL from birth. (Turn away sadly)
JACOB: (Throwing arms up in exasperation) Typical. This is so typical.
JACOB: (To MARTHA, but loud) This is classic Trevor-reverse-psychology.
JACOB: (Suddenly remembering) AND! Last time he said he raised a SNAKE. Remember the SNAKE thing?
JACOB: But it was all an elaborate excuse to get you to look at a video of a SNAKE IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
JACOB: (Up close to TREVOR) You're a sick individual.
TREVOR: (Holding up phone) Check it out.
Meanwhile JACOB: (Shield your eyes and don't look at the phone) No!
MARTHA: This is ridiculous. Now I'm super intrigued. I simply must see this PETANIMAL meme.
TREVOR: (Coy) You sure?
MARTHA: Yeah. Sure. Show me.
TREVOR: You trust me?
MARTHA: Yeah.
TREVOR: (To JACOB) See, Martha trusts me.
JACOB: (Facing away proudly) That's a mistake.
MARTHA: Oh, don't be such a coward. Besides, I'm so desensitized to videos of IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION at this point, who cares?
MARTHA: I've even made a few IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION memes myself.
MARTHA: (Grabbing TREVOR's phone) Let me see that.
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Martha takes your phone to look at it)
TREVOR: Check it out!
MARTHA: (Taking a moment to read the meme) Okay.
JACOB: (Watching in anticipation) Well? Did you fall for it?
MARTHA: I mean, it's just a picture of a PETANIMAL DOING STUFF.
MARTHA: And it has the caption, MEME CAPTION
JACOB: No way. Let me see this. (Grab phone from MARTHA and look at it)
MARTHA: It's true.
JACOB: (Reading meme out loud) MEME CAPTION.
JACOB: Well, I'll be GOBSMACKED and flabbergasted.
MARTHA: Nice meme, Trevor. (High five TREVOR)
Meanwhile TREVOR: (High five MARTHA)
JACOB: (Holding up phone) Okay. What's the catch with this?
TREVOR: (Coy) Jacob, my friend. There is virtually no catch. There's barely anything that should worry you.
JACOB: Well, I guess my day has been slightly improved by looking at this cute little PETANIMAL... (Thinking) wait a second!
JACOB: (Increasingly suspicious) Why are you being so coy? WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NOTHING SIGNIFICANT"?
JACOB: (Strangle TREVOR) WHAT DID YOU DO?
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Get strangled) Bleck! Gurk!
MARTHA: Stop! Let him go! (Pull JACOB away from TREVOR)
Meanwhile JACOB: (MARTHA pulls you away from TREVOR)
JACOB: (To TREVOR) Speak, you fiend.
TREVOR: (Maniacally) You cursed, my good fellow! By gazing upon the forbidden PETANIMAL, and speaking the incantation, you are cursed to die!
TREVOR: Cursed to die... in sixty seconds! (Evil laughter, highly amused)
MARTHA: What the heck, man!
JACOB: What kind of "The Ring" garbage is this? (To audience) Is this seriously the best conclusion the author of this skit could think of?
MARTHA: (To TREVOR) What's wrong with you? Why do this? What's your motivation?
TREVOR: (Serious) In a word.... "chaos."
JACOB: (Strangle TREVOR) You jerk! You lift this curse right now! Or I'll make you IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION!
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Getting strangled) There's nothing-- I can do-- !
MARTHA: (Looking at watch) Wait... it's definitely been at least a minute since we looked at the meme.
JACOB: (Stop strangling TREVOR) It's been a minute? And we're not dead?
JACOB: Perhaps... there is no curse?
TREVOR: (Laughing to self)
JACOB: (To TREVOR, playfully, laughing) Oh Trevor, you jerk. You had me all worried for nothing. Again!
MARTHA: (Laughing playfully) You really are a gullible little guy.
JACOB: (Sighing, putting arm around TREVOR) Classic Trevor.
MARTHA: (Looking at watch) But just to be safe, I think we should give it a few more seconds, though.
MARTHA: And if we're not dead by then, we can-- (YOU SUDDENLY DIE)
Church bell
Tense cinematic music
TREVOR: (Point and laugh at MARTHA's corpse) Hahaha! Another soul falls, in the name of PETANIMAL!
JACOB: (Increasingly building rage) Trevor... when I die... I'm going to haunt you so hard you will with you were never born!
JACOB: I'm gonna-- (YOU SUDDENLY DIE)
Church bell
Lacrimosa music
TREVOR: (Pick up phone from MARTHA's corpse, thinking to self) Now... what to make for my next cursed meme?
TREVOR: Oh I know... (typing on phone) I'll make a meme about SOMETHING
TREVOR:  And send it to everyone I know on discord... right now! (Hold phone up to audience)

HOST: Patricia, whenever you're ready, take it away!

MOTHER: (Endearing) You've been such a good boy this year, Timmy. What would you like for your birthday!
CHILD: I want a pet doggy!
MOTHER: A dog? That's a big responsibility. Okay... but you have to promise to take care of that doggy!
CHILD: I will, I promise!
MOTHER: Make sure you always remember to feed it... "INEDIBLE OBJECT"...
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants) I said, remember to feed your dog "INEDIBLE OBJECT". (Pause for a moment)
CHILD: I will, mom!
MOTHER: (To CHILD) And always take it for a walk... after it eats the "INEDIBLE OBJECT"...
CHILD: Yeah! (Pause awkwardly)
HOST: Contestants, go ahead and ring in whenever you notice something wrong with this scene...
TREVOR: (Watch the actors really intensely for a second)
CHILD: Mommy, are dogs supposed to eat "INEDIBLE OBJECT"?
MOTHER: Why yes Timmy, INEDIBLE OBJECT is made specifically for dogs to eat, inside their mouths.
MOTHER: (Rub stomach, stare at contestants) Mmm, INEDIBLE OBJECT!
Music stops, Gameshow ring
TREVOR: (Point at actors) I know what's wrong.
TREVOR: You don't really need to walk your dog as long as you have enough CLEANING SUPPLIES.
TREVOR: And they have plenty of CLEANING SUPPLIES!
HOST: No, that's... (Utterly confused) What?

ALEXA: The mom's not really hungry for INEDIBLE OBJECT, you can tell by the way she was rubbing her stomach.

TREVOR: He hasn't really been a good boy this year. Just look into his eyes. He's done unspeakable things.

ALEXA: I don't like her face.
HOST: Here's a hint: It's something about the DOG FOOD.
Gameshow ring
TREVOR: INEDIBLE OBJECT doesn't go in your mouth, God gave you a specific hole for that.
HOST: Close enough. I guess you earn one point.
HOST: You people are weird. Okay, here's your next scenario.
HOST: Hopefully this one is a bit easier, but I doubt it, since that was the FIRST round...
Guitar music 1
CHILD: Mommy?
MOTHER: What is it, Timmy?
CHILD: Where do babies come from?
MOTHER: Well, you see, Timmy, when mommy and daddy love each other very much, they...
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants) go to CHAIN RESTAURANT and eat SPECIAL INGREDIENT.
MOTHER: (To TIMMY) and nine months later, a baby is born!
CHILD: Wow! SPECIAL INGREDIENT? I had no idea!
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants and shrug) Yup!... Totally true!

HOST: That's not correct... seriously?

TREVOR: I'm pretty sure pregnancy only lasts 7 months, that's what my wife told me.
TREVOR: Which makes sense, because 9 months before our baby was born she was away on a business trip with her boss and his friends.
Gameshow ring
ALEXA: That's not her real son. The husband swapped out the babies at the hospital and she has no idea.
HOST: None of you are right, let's just move onto the next scenario.

MOTHER: (Take out cellphone, dialing number) 212-802-4444...
MOTHER: (Speaking on phone) Hello, Domino's Pizza? I'd like to order one large pizza pepperoni pizza.
MOTHER: (Staring at contestants) Yes, and a 2 liter of pepsi...
CHILD: (Coughing, vomiting) Mommy... is there supposed to be blood?
MOTHER: Hang in there, Timmy, my son! I'm calling for help right now!
MOTHER: (Talking on phone, speaking very slowly) ... by calling DOMINO'S PIZZA.
MOTHER: (Talking on phone) Why yes, I'll hold...
Music stops, Gameshow ring
TREVOR: She's stupid, if you order on the Domino's app your get a much better deal.

ALEXA: The kid doesn't need that much Pepsi, chugging a regular bottle should fix him up real good.

HUSBAND: I try to do something new and interesting, and you're always there to ruin it!
HUSBAND: Are you jealous of my ambition?
WIFE: Jealous? Are you kidding? Stop turning this on me.
WIFE: Maybe I would support your decisions if they were less reckless, Daryl!
WIFE: But you're just too irresponsible!
HUSBAND: (Even more upset) So I do one little IRRESPONSIBLE THING and that's "irresponsible"?
WIFE: Yes, that was a terrible idea!
HUSBAND: Well, I say it takes courage to IRRESPONSIBLE THING! But you would know nothing about that!
WIFE: I was a DANGEROUS OCCUPATION before I met you!
WIFE: Living a life of danger and bravery!
WIFE: Now I'm stuck cleaning up after... (gesture to husband) this!
HUSBAND: Oh yeah? What's that supposed to mean?

WIFE: Nice people who take responsibility for their actions!
HUSBAND: (Smiling through the rage) That's us, all right.

NEIGHBOR: (Make meditating pose, holding back rage) I'm trying to keep my inner peace. I really am.
NEIGHBOR: I am... calm... like a BLISSFUL SUMMER RAIN.
NEIGHBOR: (Angrily pointing at WIFE) But if you don't keep it down, I'm gonna have to call the police.
NEIGHBOR: Because this is just ridiculous.
WIFE: So sorry. We'll keep it down.
WIFE: (Looking at husband, disgusted) Besides... there's nothing more to discuss.

HUSBAND: Nothing, it's just that... you really showed that nosy neighbor who's boss.
WIFE: Yeah, well. I guess I'm just fired up from all this... drama. (Turn away in a huff)
HUSBAND: (Walking up to wife) You know... you're pretty PRETTY when you're upset.
WIFE: (Trying not to blush) Oh stop it. You're just calling me PRETTY because I'm mad at you.
HUSBAND: (Brushing her hair) How mad are you? Do you want to CHOKE me?
WIFE: (Coy) Maybe I do want to CHOKE you after all you've put me through today.
HUSBAND: (Exiting stage left) Why don't we go upstairs and you can get your revenge for all my... IRRESPONSIBLE THING?
Meanwhile WIFE: (Follow the HUSBAND)
WIFE: (Exiting stage left with HUSBAND) (Flirtatiously) we can try the DOWNWARD DOG position.
Meanwhile HUSBAND: (Exit stage left with WIFE)

AGENT: (Pacing around nervously) It's Friday. This is not good. I should have heard from headquarters by now.
AGENT: If I don't receive a message by the end of the day, my mission to DO GOOD DEED could be a complete failure.
AGENT: Was the pizza delivery last night a secret message in disguise? If so, I might have eaten it by accident.
AGENT: (Peek out the window) No sign of any friendly agents. Maybe something went wrong.
AGENT: (Noticing someone outside) Wait a moment. Who's that walking up to the house?
AGENT: Is that....?!
Doorbell
AGENT: (Calling out) One moment!
AGENT: Hmm. This could be a trap. Better take up a tactical position. (Hide behind the couch and point your gun at the door
Doorbell
AGENT: (Calling out) Come on in, the door's open!
MAILMAN: (Enter stage right) Hello? Are you sure it's okay to come inside? This is highly unconventional.
MAILMAN: (Noticing the agent) Oh, hello. I see you have a gun. I'll just be leaving now.
AGENT: Oh, this? It's just a... toy gun.
AGENT: (Lying) You see, I'm a famous movie star named FAMOUS ACTOR. You may have heard of me.
MAILMAN: FAMOUS ACTOR? Never heard of you. But that explanation makes perfect sense.
AGENT: It's my fool-proof-- I mean, totally accurate backstory.
MAILMAN: (Holding a package) Well, FAMOUS ACTOR, I am here to deliver this very important package.
AGENT: A package you say? Well, I have been expecting to receive something today.
AGENT: (Whispering to self) Perhaps this is a message from headquarters in disguise....
MAILMAN: What are you saying? I can't hear you.
AGENT: Oh, nothing. So, do I have to sign for the package or something?
MAILMAN: Let me just confirm your identity real quick.

MAILMAN: (Reading the package label) Contains 1 ORDERABLE ITEM from ORDERABLE ITEM.com.
AGENT: (Whispering to self) I didn't order any ORDERABLE ITEM... headquarters must have sent this.
AGENT: (To mail person) Yes, that's my ORDERABLE ITEM.
AGENT: You see, my old ORDERABLE ITEM broke when I tried to use it to REPAIR THING.

AGENT: (Answering phone) Who is this?
NARRATOR: Agent CODENAME, is that you?
AGENT: That depends. Who's asking? Who are you?
NARRATOR: My name is not important. What is important is that you do not open that package.

AGENT: What am I supposed to do with this?
NARRATOR: That's for you to figure out. Goodbye, agent CODENAME.
AGENT: (Putting away the phone) They hung up. Darn. Now what am I going to do?

Aww
INTERN: That doesn't seem so bad. At least we earned a profitable amount of CURRENCY, right?

WANDERER: Why did I have to wander off like this? I knew I should have stayed with the group.
WANDERER: Now I'm all alone, lost in this creepy forest... who knows what could happen out here?
SALESPERSON: (Enter) Don't worry, my good fellow. I'm here to help you.
WANDERER: Who are you? Were you following me?
SALESPERSON: Oh no, I was just happening to wander these woods myself and I overheard your predicament.
SALESPERSON: As for who I am, you can call me Elric the Elf.
WANDERER: Well, what do you want from me, Elric the Elf?
SALESPERSON: I happen to have something that might interest you greatly.
SALESPERSON: It's an insurance policy, specifically designed for travelers like yourself who find themselves lost in the forest.
WANDERER: An insurance policy? Is that really necessary?
WANDERER: Besides, I don't have much money on me right now.
SALESPERSON: Ah, but can you really put a price on peace of mind?
SALESPERSON: You're lucky it was I who appeared in the middle of these woods, and not something more sinister...
SALESPERSON: But with this policy, you'll be protected against all sorts of unforeseen dangers and mishaps.
WANDERER: I don't know... I spent all my money on BUYABLE ITEM and my parents won't increase my allowance.
SALESPERSON: It's a very reasonably priced policy. And the benefits highly outweigh the costs.
SALESPERSON: Allow me to elaborate. (Point at the floor)
SALESPERSON: What if you encounter a pit full of CREATUREs? If you fall in, well, you can imagine what might happen.
WANDERER: Oh. Would you say there are many pits full of CREATURE in the woods?
SALESPERSON: Most certainly! And what about a group of TYPE OF PERSON people, who prey on strangers in broad daylight?
WANDERER: Good heavens! I had no idea that TYPE OF PERSON posed that kind of danger!
SALESPERSON: Sorry to scare you, but yes, it's very true.
SALESPERSON: You may also wish to know that NUMBER percent of people who get lost in the woods fall victim to ILLNESS.
WANDERER: Really? ILLNESS? Out in these woods?
SALESPERSON: Of course, ILLNESS is mostly linked to genetics.... (Lean in to tell a secret)
SALESPERSON: But between you and me, I suspect a strong correlation between ILLNESS and FUN ACTIVITY here in the woods.
WANDERER: FUN ACTIVITY in these very woods? Now why would I be doing that?
SALESPERSON: You might come across a TYPE OF PERSON who wants to FUN ACTIVITY. You know, peer pressure.
WANDERER: I suppose if I saw a TYPE OF PERSON doing FUN ACTIVITY then I might be inclined to join in...
SALESPERSON: Exactly! So you'll want an insurance policy to protect you in the event of FUN ACTIVITY ILLNESS.
WANDERER: Well when you put it like that, I would be silly not to have insurance. Where do I sign?
SALESPERSON: Well, it's such a popular policy that I ran out of scrolls.
SALESPERSON: But for now, you can sign my BODY PART. Here's a pen! (Hold out a pen)
WANDERER: (Take the pen and sign the BODY PART) There you go!

TYPEWRITER: Court Case #112389;Becky Brown v. David Dickson
BAILIFF: All rise for the honorable Judge NAME!
JUDGE: (enter stage and sit on judge's chair)
(Music stops)
JUDGE: You may be seated.
BAILIFF: Hello, your honor. This is the case of Brown vs. Dickson. 
JUDGE: Thank you, officer. Lets see... (look over files) It says here that Ms. Becky Brown insists that Mr. David Dickson is the father of her AGE month old child.
JUDGE: However, Mr. Dickson claims the kid isn't his.
JUDGE: Ms. Brown, please give the court a brief history on your relationship with Mr. Dickson.
BECKY: (stand up) Yes, your honor. David and I met back in high school and we were sweethearts until a little over AGE months ago. 
BECKY: I'm not sure what happened, but David didn't seem to love me as much when I became pregnant. 
DAVID: That's because you've been sleeping around!
BECKY: I have not! That's not true!
JUDGE: (bang gavel) There will be order in this court! Ms. Brown, please continue.
BECKY: We had been married for about a year, and then David decided to file for divorce days after I told him we we're gonna start a family!
BECKY: I believe he's just avoiding the responsibility of raising child. (sit down)
JUDGE: Mr. Dickson, what is your statement?
DAVID: (stand up) I'm not going to take care of a child that isn't mine. Becky cheated on me!
DAVID: I left for a business trip, and I came back to a positive pregnancy test.
BECKY: Oh PET, do you not remember that night we had together before you left? We were going for HOURS hours!
DAVID: But we've discussed many times that we aren't ready for kids!
BECKY: How do I know you didn't leave to cheat on me then? You've never left on a business trip before!
DAVID: I got a promotion!
BECKY: You work at WORK!
JUDGE: (bang gavel) Order! Order in my court please. Mr. Dickson, is there any further reason why you believe this child isn't yours?
DAVID: Like I just said, Becky and I have talked about how we wanted to wait to have kids many times.
DAVID: We had just moved to CITY, got new jobs, and we wanted to have enough money saved up first. 
DAVID: Plus, even though our date nights would get a little "involved" sometimes, we were always sure to be safe. (sit down)
JUDGE: Well, anything can happen, no matter how safe you think you're being. This is where the DNA test comes in. 
JUDGE: Bailiff, please retrieve the results.
BAILIFF: Yes, your honor. (leave stage)
BECKY: I just want my husband back. I miss the love we had.
DAVID: I bet you miss our love because the real father doesn't want to take care of the kid either. 
BECKY: I told you a thousand times, I didn't cheat!
DAVID: (sarcastically) Yeah, right. I've seen how you look at the neighbor.
BAILIFF: (return to stage, hand imaginary folder to judge) The results, your honor.
JUDGE: (take imaginary folder from bailiff) Thank you. These results were prepared by DNA Diagnostics, and they read as follows...
JUDGE: In the case of Brown v. Dickson, when it comes to the AGE month old child, it has been determined by this court.....
JUDGE: Mr. David Dickson, you........

Detective Pikachu: Making the streets of this city wet and runny, Just how I like my COFFEE
Detective Pikachu: We've been getting fewer cases as of late, but a detective never surrenders to the sounds of silence-
Detective Pikachu: only more alert for the next case, another puzzle to solve in this part of town in Ryme City.
Detective Pikachu: *Walks towards the desk and sits*
Detective Pikachu: Say- Where's my partner Tim?
Detective Pikachu: He was supposed to be back here hours ago with my cup of COFFEE.
Detective Pikachu: Hope he's all okay, I hope he didn't fall into some MUD on his way back.
(Knocking on door)
Detective Pikachu: Come in, door's open
Tim: *opens the door and walks in *
Pokemon: * walks in with Tim*

Pokemon: SNOM! SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: What the?! A SNOM!?
Tim: I found this LITTLE SNOM on the streets looking sad and worried, so I thought maybe we could help it out.
Detective Pikachu: So wait, No COFFEE?
Tim: ahh, well *Looks away*
Detective Pikachu: Did the SNOM drink all my COFFEE?! *Points to the Pokemon in anger*
Pokemon: *shakes head* SNOM SNOM SNOM!
Tim: No no, it's just when I was heading back to the office I bumped into someone and all the COFFEE fell into the MUD.
(Lacrimosa Music)
Detective Pikachu: Noooooo, I was looking forward to drinking that COFFEE.
Tim: Pikachu you have been drinking too much COFFEE these past few days, thats not right.
(Shark Tank positive music)
Detective Pikachu: Your right, sorry. No use crying over spilled COFFEE. 
Detective Pikachu: Besides, right now we have an SNOM in need.
Detective Pikachu: *Walks up to the Pokemon* So, what happened to you? 
Pokemon: SNOM SNOM SNOM, SNOM SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: *Nods* Mhm and then?
Pokemon: SNOM SNOM, SNOM SNOM!
Pokemon: *feeling sad* SNOM SNOM.
Tim: Uhh, What is it saying?
Detective Pikachu: *Looks at Tim* It seems like this LITTLE SNOM here lost its partner and doesn't know where to go.
Pokemon: SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: It was asleep till it woke up from a fall and was dazed for quite a bit.
Detective Pikachu: Then you came along and the rest is history.
Tim: Can it describe what its partner looks like, maybe I saw them while I was out.

(Anime sword gleam 1)

Detective Pikachu: ) *Looks at the audience, Claps, and points up* A Bolt of Brilliance! I know where your partner is LITTLE SNOM.
(Noir music 3)
Tim: Really? Do you know where they are?
Detective Pikachu: I'm surprised you didn't pick up on it too Tim. 
Detective Pikachu: You went out to get me my large cup of COFFEE.
Detective Pikachu: And since my order of COFFEE was so large you've probably focused your attention more on not spilling the COFFEE than on your surroundings.
Detective Pikachu: Around the same time SNOM's TALL BEARD partner was too tired to see where they were walking and bumped into you.
Detective Pikachu: Not only spilling my delicious COFFEE but also knocking SNOM off of its partner in the process.
Tim: But if all that was true then where would SNOM's partner be?
Detective Pikachu: *walks towards the door* Where else do I go to get my fix to wake me up?
Detective Pikachu: At the CAFE SHOP!
Tim: This better not be an excuse to get more COFFEE
Detective Pikachu: Trust me, Tim. This Detective is never wrong.
Detective Pikachu: *leaves through the door*

CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Cackle like a goblin) I THIRST FOR BLOOD.
DUNGEON MASTER: Very good. Last we left off, you were following a MYTHICAL CREATURE into an enchanted glade, when suddenly, you got lost!
NEWBIE PLAYER: I recall! Our MYTHICAL CREATURE guide suddenly disappeared, that rascal! I hope it returns soon.
BORED PLAYER: Huh? I don't remember that.
DUNGEON MASTER: Maybe because you spent the entire last session playing MOBILE GAME on your phone.
BORED PLAYER: (Shrug and play games on your phone) Not my fault MOBILE GAME is more entertaining than your dumb game.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: No! It's gone?! But I was going to pickpocket the MYTHICAL CREATURE and steal its TREASURE while it wasn't looking!
DUNGEON MASTER: I already told you, you can't do that. It's impossible.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: But I rolled a 20! Fine, can I steal its BODY PART when it comes back and sell it back in town?
DUNGEON MASTER: Also impossible. Besides, that would initiate combat. Are you sure you want to do that?
NEWBIE PLAYER: No, no! We're only level 1, and that MYTHICAL CREATURE is supposed to be our guide through these woods.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: And look where it's gotten us! We're lost! We should have killed it while it was WACKY ACTION.
BORED PLAYER: This sucks. I'm bored. I'm ordering a pizza. (Put your phone to your ear) Hi, Instant Pizza? I'd like to place an order.
DUNGEON MASTER: Hey! It's not that boring! Now look, you're lost in a magical wood. It's foggy and there's no signs of civilization. What do you do?

NEWBIE PLAYER: (Point to BORED PLAYER) You there, you're a ranger! Do you recognize these odd tracks? Do they belong to the MYTHICAL CREATURE that was guiding us?
BORED PLAYER: (Look up from your phone) Uh, how should I know?
DUNGEON MASTER: You can roll a Survival check, you INSULT.
BORED PLAYER: You're the INSULT, INSULT. (Roll some dice)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: I set the giant spider webs on fire then do a triple front flip somersault through them!
DUNGEON MASTER: Wait your turn, Rogue. Ranger, what was your roll?
Knocking on door
BORED PLAYER: Who cares? Pizza's here. (Walk to the door and open it)
PIZZA GUY: Hi, Instant Pizza! Hot, fresh, ADJECTIVE pizza delivered to your door instantaneously. Sorry I'm late. Here's your pizza with extra TOPPING!
BORED PLAYER: No prob, dude. Come put it on the table. (Walk back to the table)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Follow BORED PLAYER back to the table)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: I changed my mind. I push the wizard into the spider webs!
DUNGEON MASTER: Uhh, ok. Roll Athletics.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Roll some dice) 13! Did I do it? Is the wizard going to be eaten!? (Point at NEWBIE PLAYER) I hope they lay eggs in you! Mwahaha!
NEWBIE PLAYER: You greatly disturb me, Rogue. Dungeon master, can't I dodge or something?
PIZZA GUY: Oh cool, you guys are playing D&D? I'm a dungeon master myself. (Set the pizza down)
DUNGEON MASTER: (Point at Pizza Guy) Yes, and you're very rudely interrupting our game! 
DUNGEON MASTER: Alright Wizard, the Rogue pushes you into the spider webs. Four giant Phase Spiders suddenly appear around you, gnashing their teeth hungrily.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: Yes! Feast upon his squishy magic BODY PART! Mwahaha!
NEWBIE PLAYER: What's with you and your obsession with BODY PARTs?
PIZZA GUY: Wait, doesn't the wizard get to contest the roll?
DUNGEON MASTER: Huh? Contest the roll?
PIZZA GUY: Well that was a shove. According to page 195 of the Player's Handbook, the wizard gets to roll Athletics or Acrobatics to contest the rogue's check.
NEWBIE PLAYER: I do?
DUNGEON MASTER: They do? I mean, yes of course. I knew that! I was just getting to that before you interrupted me.
DUNGEON MASTER: Fine, you can roll, but don't use those metal dice again, or-
Meanwhile NEWBIE PLAYER: (Roll some dice)
Crashing debris
NEWBIE PLAYER: 14. Do I win?
DUNGEON MASTER: (Tired) No, the spider webs are too sticky and- (look at Pizza Guy as you're talked over)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Loud) Yeah! 14 is higher than 13, so the Rogue fails to push you. Congrats, you're not stuck in the spider webs!
DUNGEON MASTER: Excuse me, but this is my table. You can't just come in here and decide what happens! Make your own game if you want to be the DM.
NEWBIE PLAYER: I don't know, I kind of like the new guy. He kept me from getting eaten by spiders.
BORED PLAYER: He brought us pizza too, so I like him.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: He foiled my plans, but... Hey, pizza guy! You know stuff about this game! Tell me, is it really impossible to steal a BODY PART from a MYTHICAL CREATURE?
PIZZA GUY: Well sure it's possible. There's rules for harvesting body parts, crafting them into magic items, stuff like that. It's all in the books.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You liar! How dare you deprive me of MYTHICAL CREATURE BODY PART?
NEWBIE PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You would've let me die if the pizza guy didn't correct you! I cast SPELL on you!
BORED PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You keep distracting me from grinding in MOBILE GAME with dice rolls and silly voices.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Look at NEWBIE PLAYER.) Mutiny? (Quick nod. Grab DUNGEON MASTER and drag him out the door)

Brain: Wait, Pinky are you pondering what I'm pondering
Pinky: I think so brain, But I'm not sure how an Oprah singing GHOST that's BOWING would help us with winning the next bingo night.
Brain: No pinky, it's just that I realized you have no experience in the medical field.
Brain: I must perform the surgery myself *puts on disguise*

MAIN DETECTIVE: That rings name goes by CRN, yeah I know, shocker.
MAIN DETECTIVE: But they do hide their deals well through CRN.
MAIN DETECTIVE: They mainly deal substances around the same tune as SBS which has killed many people due to its sheer addictiveness.

CHRIS: I'm gonna be late for FOOTBALL practice!
TEACHER: You all are being punished for what you did to the school mascot, FRUMPY the DRAGON.
ALICE: That stupid DRAGON had it coming.
CHRIS: FRUMPY the DRAGON looked at me funny. And as the most "badass" kid in school, I can't let that slide.
ALICE: So we PRANK. It had to be done.
CHRIS: It has to be done, it had to be PRANK.
TEACHER: (Sigh) Which is why our school specifically has a policing against PRANK.
BOBBY: (Nerdy) Erm actually, I only came up with the idea to PRANK, however, I did not actually execute the plan, heh.
ALICE: Shut up you nerd!
Meanwhile CHRIS: Shut up you nerd!
TEACHER: Well, to make sure you learn that your actions have consequences, you all have to stay for THREE HOURS.
TEACHER: And there's someone who wants to have a word with you.
MASCOT: (Enter) Hey, kids. It's me, FRUMPY the DRAGON. (Stand next to teacher)
TEACHER: Now kids, you're gonna listen to how you made FRUMPY feel. Tell them, FRUMPY.
MASCOT: When you kids did PRANK on me...
ALICE: (High-five CHRIS) Tee hee! Tee hee!
Meanwhile CHRIS: (High-five ALICE) Nice. Epic prank.
TEACHER: Be quiet you delinquents! Eyes forward! Experience empathy!
MASCOT: When you kids did PRANK on me, it made me feel... UPSET.
TEACHER: How would you kids feel if someone did "PRANK" on YOU?
ALICE: (Proud) Bah. I'm impervious to feeling UPSET.
BOBBY: Nobody could PRANK me. I would clearly outsmart them and counter-attack like a NINJA.
CHRIS: My dad makes me feel UPSET every other night if I don't win at the FOOTBALL games.
ALICE: Who cares if the DRAGON mascot is UPSET, so what?
ALICE: The DRAGON mascot doesn't even look like a DRAGON.
TEACHER: That's because you're bad at life
Vine boom
MASCOT: You know what, I'm fed up with this. Last year it was OTHERJOKE, this year it's PRANK.
MASCOT: And these kids don't even care that I'm UPSET.
MASCOT: They only care about FOOTBALL and FORTNITE
MASCOT: I quit!
CHRIS: Wait, FRUMPY the DRAGON! Without you, who will cheer on my FOOTBALL games?
MASCOT: I don't know. Figure it out yourself. (Take off mascot costume and throw it on the ground)
MASCOT: (Upset) Good day to you... rotten kids... (Exit the stage)
TEACHER: Look what you did. I hope you kids are happy.
TEACHER: You know what? (Point to leftmost kid) You. What's your name again?
ALICE: Me? My name is WHATEVERNAME
TEACHER: Whatever. Because you're the new FRUMPY now. Get in the DRAGON costume.
ALICE: Aww, do I have to?
TEACHER: Do it or you all get an "F-" in GEOGRAPHY.
ALICE: (Sigh) Fine. (Get in the DRAGON costume)
BOBBY: (Pointing at new mascot) Hey look! It's FRUMPY the DRAGON!
CHRIS: (Mischievous) Heh. Let's ACTION it.
TEACHER: By all means, ACTION away. Then you can see how it feels...
TEACHER: And you might learn your lesson!

TEACHER: (Looking up at bell) Wow. Was it THREE HOURS already?
ALICE: We're free! (Exit)

CHRIS: FOOTBALL, here I come! Yeet! (Exit)

Noir Music 3 
MISS SCARLETT: (Looking around) Well, the air certainly is Charged tonight, isn't it? There's nothing like a good storm to set the mood for unraveling a mystery. 
PROFESSOR PLUM: Indeed, Detective. The Unseasonable demise of our dear Mr. NOUN9 leaves us with many questions.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Most pressing: who among us is the perpetrator of this vile deed?
MRS. PEACOCK: (fan yourself with a clue card) It's all quite unbearable to think that one of us could be capable of murder. I feel like I could faint at the very notion! 
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Pound your fist on the table) Enough of this dilly-dallying! I say we get to the bottom of this. 
COLONEL MUSTARD: Someone here is the murderer.
COLONEL MUSTARD: And I won't rest until we've sniffed 'em out!
MISS SCARLETT: I agree, Colonel. Let us begin our inquiry. Please, everyone, take a moment to recall your Whereabouts at the time of Mr. NOUN9's unfortunate... accident.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Well, I was in the NOUN1—entirely engrossed in a fascinating volume about NOUN2. The time simply slipped away from me.
MISS SCARLETT: You'll have to enlighten me about this NOUN2 after our mystery, Mr. Plum.
MRS. PEACOCK: And I was having a delightful conversation in the NOUN3. The orchids there are just divine this time of year.
COLONEL MUSTARD: I was in the NOUN4, engaging in a bit of solitary practice. No one can accuse me of cheating when I was alone the whole time!
MISS SCARLETT: Yes, well, we shall see if your alibis hold up. Now let's examine the available evidence. Where exactly was Mr. NOUN9 found?
PROFESSOR PLUM: His body was in the NOUN5, right on the floor. Poor chap.
MISS SCARLETT: And the murder weapon?
MRS. PEACOCK: (Gasping) Oh, it was something dreadful—a NOUN6, if you can believe it! Such a lovely piece, turned into an instrument of death.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Inspecting the cards) And what of the fingerprint analysis and the footprints? We can't overlook any detail, no matter how small.
MISS SCARLETT: Precisely, Colonel. Now, we all had access to a NOUN6, and it could easily have been transported to the NOUN5.
MISS SCARLETT:  We must scrutinize our evidence and interrogate one another until cracks in our stories are revealed.
TYPEWRITER: After lots of discoveries later
Shark Tank serious music 1
MISS SCARLETT: (Holding up a notepad) Now, let's recount our discoveries. Colonel Mustard, you claim to have been in the NOUN4. 
MISS SCARLETT: But a torn matchbook from the lounge was found in your Jacket. Care to explain?
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Stammering) Well, yes, I... I might have stopped by the NOUN1. But for a harmless drink! It means nothing, I assure you.
PROFESSOR PLUM: (Intrigued) A drink, you say? Or perhaps to pick up a handy NOUN6?
MRS. PEACOCK: But let's not forget the NOUN8 found beside the flowerpot in the conservatory.
MRS. PEACOCK: This means somebody could have used to stroll through the secret passage to the NOUN3.
MISS SCARLETT: (Eyeing Mrs. Peacock) A valid point. The secret passages aren't common knowledge, Mrs. Peacock. Your familiarity is... curious.
MRS. PEACOCK: (Whispering to themself) This is not how it was supposed to...
MISS SCARLETT: (Overhearing) Something you’d like to share with the group, Mrs. Peacock?
PROFESSOR PLUM: And let's not overlook the NOUN7 found in NOUN3—a perfect tool for a... scholarly type to utilize in a violent manner.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Nodding) Ah, Professor, were you not alone with your precious books around the time of the... incident?
MISS SCARLETT: (Tapping the notepad) We've had our share of bluffs and deflections. It's time we cut through the noise. 
MISS SCARLETT: The NOUN7 was also found dusted with ash—suggesting it was recently near the fireplace here in this very room.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Pointedly) Well then, Detective, it seems you're the only one without a suspect item tied to 'em. How do we know it wasn't you?
MISS SCARLETT: (Smiling slightly) Because, dear Colonel, unlike our hidden assailant, I do not stand to gain from Mr. NOUN9's untimely demise. 
MISS SCARLETT: And my fingerprints were not found on the murder weapon.
MISS SCARLETT: The NOUN8, the NOUN7, the scattered pages from Mr. NOUN9's diary—all of these paint a damning picture. It is time for the culprits to reveal themselves.
MISS SCARLETT: (Slowly) And that person is...
MISS SCARLETT: (With finality) Mrs. Peacock!
Thunder
Noir music 4
MRS. PEACOCK: (Shocked) Me? Oh, Detective, surely you jest! How could you possibly think that I, a lady of my standing, could commit such a heinous act?
MISS SCARLETT: (Raising an eyebrow) The clues do not lie, Mrs. Peacock. Yes, everyone had access to a NOUN6, but not everyone had a motive.
MISS SCARLETT: The torn page from the guestbook found near the body contained a cryptic message in your handwriting.
MISS SCARLETT: And the orchid you so admire—its specific pollen was found on Mr. NOUN9's cuff.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Quite the deduction, Detective. It's always the details that give the game away.
COLONEL MUSTARD: And what about the footprints leading to the NOUN3? A distinctive tread pattern that matches none other than Mrs. Peacock's heels!
MRS. PEACOCK: This is preposterous! I've been framed! I would never soil my hands with such... such...
MISS SCARLETT: ...guilt? I do believe you protested a tad too much throughout our investigation. 
MISS SCARLETT: The truth always emerges, Mrs. Peacock. As they say, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Nodding with satisfaction) Splendid work, Detective. Justice will be served tonight.
MRS. PEACOCK: It... It was the money, you see. Mr. NOUN9 threatened to cut me off, to reveal my little... indiscretions. I couldn't allow that.
MISS SCARLETT: (Sympathetically) A tragic end to a desperate measure.
Knocking on door
POLICEMAN: Detective Scarlet, we received your call. Is this the suspect?
MISS SCARLETT: (Nods) Yes, officer. Take her into custody.
POLICEMAN: (Handcuffs Mrs. Peacock) Put your hands behind your back, Mrs. Peacock, you're going away for a long time.
Meanwhile MRS. PEACOCK: (Puts her hands behind her back as she gets cuffed)
POLICEMAN: (Walks out of the room with Mrs. Peacock)
Meanwhile MRS. PEACOCK: (Walks out of the room with the policeman) Let me go! These are just filthy liars!
MISS SCARLETT: Another case closed, thanks to deduction and attention to detail. Although, let's hope our next gathering is under less... murderous circumstances.

MODERATOR: Welcome to debate number NUMBER of the next United States presidential election! 
applause
MODERATOR: This year’s candidates are still running neck-and-neck in the polls, so this is their last chance to make their case.
MODERATOR: So, let’s get right to it. First, please join me in extending a warm welcome to our first candidate, Senator NAME 1!
applause
CANDIDATE 1: Thank you! Thank you all.
MODERATOR: And on the opposite side of the political spectrum, let’s give it up for our second candidate, Governor NAME 2!
applause
CANDIDATE 2: Good evening, everyone! Thank you for voting for me!
laughter
MODERATOR: Now let’s not get ahead of ourselves, but let’s get right to it.
MODERATOR: Senator NAME 1, do you support POLITICAL ISSUE?
CANDIDATE 1: Well, I have friends who support POLITICAL ISSUE, and I have friends who oppose POLITICAL ISSUE.
CANDIDATE 1: And if you want to know where I stand – I stand with my friends!
MODERATOR: So, you’re basically a pro-friends candidate.
CANDIDATE 1: That’s right.
applause
MODERATOR: Okay then. Governor NAME 2. Do you support war or peace?
CANDIDATE 2: Well, that depends on what you mean. 
CANDIDATE 2: Like, what do you really mean when you say “war”? And, are you talking about “peace peace,” or just about “PEACEFUL THING”?
MODERATOR: You may define the terms however you like.
CANDIDATE 2: So, there’s the question. War or peace? Peace or war? What really matters is what you stand for.
MODERATOR: “What really matters is what you stand for.” Profound indeed. May we quote you on that?
CANDIDATE 2: Absolutely.
applause
MODERATOR: Great. Okay. So now let’s get down to the things that really set you apart. Senator NAME 1 – FOOD 1 or FOOD 2?
CANDIDATE 1: FOOD 1.
MODERATOR: And Senator NAME 2, same question for you. FOOD 1 or FOOD 2?
CANDIDATE 2: FOOD 2. Definitely.
MODERATOR: So, there you have it, folks. A clear distinction. Now for the twist – what about voters who don’t like either FOOD 1 or FOOD 2, but like FOOD 3 instead?
CANDIDATE 1: That's what third parties are for.
CANDIDATE 2: I agree. Let those people vote for somebody else.
MODERATOR: Wow – bipartisan agreement. What a tough choice this election year is going to be!
applause
MODERATOR: Okay, the next question is to Senator NAME 1. What would you sell your soul for?
CANDIDATE 1: Um, I'm afraid that ship's already sailed.
MODERATOR: Excuse me?
CANDIDATE 1: Yeah, sorry, I have nothing left to sell.
MODERATOR: Well then. Governor NAME 2, what about you? What would you sell your soul for?
CANDIDATE 2: Actually, I've already taken out one primary mortgage on my soul, and I've already taken out two soul equity loans, so there's that. 
MODERATOR: So basically, you're an all-in candidate. In for a penny, in for a pound, is that right?
CANDIDATE 2: Yes, that's right. Once I set my mind to something, I'll do anything to get it done.
applause
MODERATOR: Very good, both of you. So, let’s get to closing statements. Senator NAME 1, why should the American people vote for you?
CANDIDATE 1: My fellow Americans, for too long, FOOD 2 has dominated the culinary landscape. 
CANDIDATE 1: Don’t you think it’s high time that FOOD 1 is mandated to be offered by every restaurant and cafeteria in our country?
CANDIDATE 1: A vote for NAME 1 is a vote for FOOD 1.
MODERATOR: Very persuasive. Governor NAME 2, your turn. Why should the American people vote for you instead?
CANDIDATE 2: I can think of one very good reason.
CANDIDATE 2: Because VERY GOOD REASON.

KAREN: (Passive aggressive) Karen. Karen NAME3 . And you should have known that, seeing that i have an appointment (check watch) right now.
DOCTOR: Your appointment was at 2:45 pm, that's over half an hour ago. You said you've been waiting for 10 minutes.
KAREN: Yeah but It's not my fault i was late, it's the baby's. Dumb thing puked all over my ITEM and I had to go to the store to get something to clean it.

KAREN: And if you wouldn't have made me wait or have to argue with you, i would have already been back to take care of it.
RECEPTIONIST: Oh my god, the poor baby. What is wrong with you? Should we be calling the police?
DOCTOR: I believe that's not gonna be necessary. Karen was just leaving.
KAREN: What? You said i have to wait!
DOCTOR: I said you would have had to wait. But instead, you're making a huge scene. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the property.
KAREN: (Evil Laughing) Yeah, no. That's not gonna happen. I want to speak to your manager.

DOCTOR: Do you not know how doctor's offices work?

KAREN: Besides, what could he have that is more important that my INFECTION ?
DOCTOR: NAME2 has ILLNESS , a terminal illness that will kill him in approximately the next 20 days.
SICK KID: (Shocked) WHAT? You said 15 months at our last appointment! (Freak out and start crying and coughing)
DOCTOR: I did, but that was before you told me about all of the MED1 earlier.
Meanwhile RECEPTIONIST: Okay, Guys?
SICK KID: You said the MED1 was "just a little bit concerning"!

BABY: (Enter) There you are, Karen.
BABY: (Get close to Karen) Now you listen here. Do you have any idea what it takes for a baby to break out of a locked car in the burning sun of midsummer?
BABY: I had to hot wire the car WRONGLY so i could open up the car doors without a key while being both dehydrated and having slippy fingers from excessive sweat.
BABY: AND. WHILE BEING. A BABY.
SICK KID: (Panicked) Am I dead already or is anyone else seeing a baby with a grown man's voice right now?
RECEPTIONIST: Oh my god. Karen, what... is... your baby?
double bass music
KAREN: Ugh, it's not "my" Baby. It's FAMILYMEMBER's Kid. They're just having me take care of it because i owe them.
DOCTOR: Ah... well i suppose that explains it...
BABY: Yea mate. I'm just a baby, that talks. That's about it. JoeyPie was high as hell when she wrote this script.
DOCTOR: Yeah, figures... (Awkward silence, cough)

STELLA: Am I missing something here?
MARK: Maybe or maybe not!
STELLA: Come on guys, what happened? (Suspicious) You're hiding something aren't you?
IAN: (Nervous laugh) Why would we hide anything!? We're the most trustworthy people on planet earth!
STELLA: Doubt it.
MARK: Do you want us to tell you what happened?
STELLA: Go ahead.
MARK: A weird dude came out and went "hi I'm an evil monster!" But he was not evil, like, at all!

CIVILIAN: Well, I've seen tons of TV shows, and I think I have an idea of what to do.

HERO: Of course! But what would it be!
CIVILIAN: Well, did the monster look like some kind of animal?
SIDEKICK: A(n) ANIMAL, I think?
HERO: Bingo! That must have something to do with its weakness!
CIVILIAN: Or it could be something random, like WEAKNESS, or something.
HERO: ...There is most certainly a more logical weakness.
SIDEKICK: Well, it wouldn't hurt to try it out. If we fail, we could just brainstorm a bit more.

RED: Good evening. Thank you all for coming to this emergency meeting.
GREEN: But what's the emergency, Red? Did Blue eat your FOOD again?
BLUE: Shut up, Green!
RED: No, nothing like that. This problem is far more serious...
RED: (look at audience) We have a OCCUPATION among us!
vine boom
PURPLE: What?! A OCCUPATION? That's impossible!
RED: Unfortunately, Purple, it's the truth. I can't deny the evidence I witnessed.
RED: It was only a couple of minutes ago that I walked into the ROOM. That's where I saw it:
RED: The dead body of NAME!
BLUE: (gasp) Somebody killed NAME?! You monster! They were my favorite crewmate!
GREEN: (look at audience) Who would do such a thing among us?
vine boom
RED: That's what we're here to find out. One of you is the OCCUPATION behind the murder of NAME.
RED: Clearly, it couldn't have been me, because I'm the one who called this meeting.
PURPLE: It wasn't me, either! I was busy TASK.
RED: Then that leaves three suspects. Got anything to say for yourselves?
BLUE: You said the body was in the ROOM? That's interesting...
BLUE: (point at Green) Because the last time I saw Green, they were heading into the ROOM with NAME!
GREEN: What? You're lying! I did no such thing! I haven't been in the ROOM all day!
GREEN: (point at Blue) I think you're making that up because YOU'RE the killer!
BLUE: Oh come on! Of course the OCCUPATION would try and pin it on the one accusing them!
GREEN: And that's exactly the kind of thing the OCCUPATION would say to avoid suspicion!
BLUE: Oh yeah? Well... INSULT!
GREEN: No, INSULT!
BLUE: Nuh uh!
GREEN: The hell you mean nuh uh?!
BLUE: (talking over Green) You serve no purpose in life! Your life is nothing! You serve zero purpose! You should vote yourself off NOW!
MEANWHILE GREEN: (talking over Blue) I'm just a little guy! I wouldn't hurt a fly! It's also my birthday! I'm a little birthday boy!
PURPLE: Will the both of you SHUT UP?!
PURPLE: Just because you stopped being RELATIONSHIP with each other doesn't mean you should throw out false accusations!
RED: Purple is right. All this meaningless arguing back and forth gets us nowhere.
RED: If this continues... (look at audience) the OCCUPATION will continue to fester among us.
vine boom
PURPLE: Hey... wait a minute... Yellow has been awfully quiet...
RED: What's the matter, Yellow? ANIMAL got your tongue?
YELLOW: Oh- no- nothing like that! I was just- um- uh- thinking about- THING! Yes, THING!
RED: Hmm, yes, I see. And what does that have to do with the murder of NAME?
YELLOW: Okay- listen- I know I look really sus right now- but- trust me, I didn't do it!
YELLOW: I definitely didn't kill NAME in the ROOM with a WEAPON!
PURPLE: ...nobody mentioned anything about a WEAPON.
YELLOW: Ah crap.
RED: Well, that settles it. (raise hand) I vote Yellow as the OCCUPATION.
PURPLE: (raise hand) I also vote Yellow.
GREEN: (raise hand) We vote Yellow.
MEANWHILE BLUE: (raise hand) We vote Yellow.

STEPHEN: We don’t have to worry about the dangers of being bitten, eaten, or poisoned by any other fish!
CHARLIE: Umm false. You poison us everyday with that stinky (FISHPART), and I just can’t stand it anymore.

SON: (Pauses for a moment, then turns to look at DAD) A what?
DAD: I said there's a FRANKENSTEIN in the attic.
SON: (short pause) A FRANKENSTEIN?
DAD: Yeah! You know, big, ugly mean monster guy! You tellin' me you don't know what a FRANKENSTEIN is?
SON: Dad, I know who FRANKENSTEIN is. Why are you saying there's one up in the attic?
DAD: Do I look like I know how a FRANKENSTEIN would get into the attic? Maybe one laid its eggs in the insulation or something.
(LAUGHTER)
SON: I'm pretty sure FRANKENSTEIN wouldn't lay eggs in the insulation.
DAD: What, you a FRANKENSTEIN expert all of a sudden?
(LAUGHTER)
SON: Okay dad, why specifically are you saying a fictional movie monster is up in the attic?
DAD: 'Cos it's up there! You think I'd be standin' down here, tellin' you there's a FRANKENSTEIN in the ATTIC if there wasn't a FRANKENSTEIN in the attic?
(LAUGHTER)
SON: I mean, given we're talking about a fictional character, yeah, I'd say you would.
DAD: Are you sayin' I'm a LIAR?!
SON: No, I'm saying you saw something else up there. Maybe it was a RACCOON.
DAD: You'd think I'd mistake a RACCOON for a FRANKENSTEIN? I've had a RACCOON up in the attic, first time I've ever had a FRANKENSTEIN!
(LAUGHTER)
SON: Well how do you know it's a FRANKENSTEIN anyway?
DAD: What, you think I waited around for him to pull out his ID? Do I look like an official FRANKENSTEIN inspector to you?

(LAUGHTER)
SON: Okay, listen, we're not going anywhere.
DAD: Why not?
SON: Because I think you're just making this up.
DAD: So you are calling me a LIAR!
SON: I think this is just a ridiculous excuse for you to get out of doing your half of the chores!
DAD: You really think I'd make up something that serious?!
SON: It's not serious, it's stupid! You really expect me to believe that a FRANKENSTEIN is up in the attic?!
DAD: Well...If you don't believe me, you can just stay here.
SON: I will!
DAD: And when you get torn apart by the FRANKENSTEIN, I'll just have to say "that was my poor son, he didn't listen to his dad about the FRANKENSTEIN."

knocking on door
DETECTIVE: (to the door) Come in. Make yourself feel at home.
LADY: (enter the door, then close it) You're the new detective everyone's talking about?
DETECTIVE: (to the lady) That's me, miss. What can I do for you today? Missing VALUABLE? Murder?
LADY: Worse, Detective. I can't find my poor sweet ANYTHING CREATURE.
DETECTIVE: (to the audience) Boy if I wasn't the luckiest person alive, I'd be wallowing in FILTHY.
DETECTIVE: Besides, this figure looks prettier than a royal CELEBRATION.
DETECTIVE: (to the lady) Ma'am, you're just in luck. I was actually reading a book on ANYTHING just now.
LADY: Oh, detective! You must have psychic powers!
DETECTIVE: If that were the case dear, I'd be rich, and there'd be less criminal ACTIONING going around.

DETECTIVE: (to audience) I didn't know what this babe was pulling on me here, but she has me in a tight spot.
DETECTIVE: One wrong move and my career is kaput.

DETECTIVE: If your CREATURE truly is missing, I'd be willing to help you with finding him or her.

DETECTIVE: I'd say around NUMBER.
LADY: Wait, what would that be in?
DETECTIVE: I'm wagering CURRENCY. But then again, my name is Lucky, both in good and bad. (exit through the door)

Jazz music 1
TEACHER: Okay class, today we're going to continue learning about GEOGRAPHY.
TEACHER: Now, yesterday we left off with how GEOGRAPHY was a result of CATASTROPHIC WORLD EVENT...
TEACHER: Everybody take out your calculators.
ALEX: You mean our ROCKS?
TEACHER: Yep, the ROCKS we use every day to calculate the answers to GEOGRAPHY problems.
SAMMY: But Mr. HAMSWORTHY, I left my ROCKS at home!
TEACHER: That's okay, Sammy, you can borrow my ROCKS. (Hand SAMMY ROCKS)
TEACHER: These ROCKS were passed down, generation after generation, starting with my great grandfather, Elder HAMSWORTHY the first.
ALEX: Mr. HAMSWORTHY, these ROCKS aren't very good at calculating things.
ALEX: My cousin goes to Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs, and they have advanced electronic ROCKS that can calculate GEOGRAPHY way easier.
SAMMY: Yeah, my hands hurt from operating this ancient old ROCKS. What's the point? We won't have to calculate GEOGRAPHY in the real world anyway.
TEACHER: Now students, first of all, you're missing the big picture.
TEACHER: You gotta learn the fundamentals. You can't just assume you can google the answers to your GEOGRAPHY problems.
TEACHER: My great grandfather HAMSWORTHY Senior Senior Senior the first started on ROCKS and that's what you'll do too.
TEACHER: Besides, you know our school doesn't have the kind of funding that Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs has.
TEACHER: Now, students, it's time for a pop GEOGRAPHY quiz.
ALEX: (Groan in disappointment) Awwww!
Meanwhile SAMMY: (Groan in disappointment) Awwww!
TEACHER: Listen closely. If Alice has 3 APPLES, and Bob has 5 APPLES, and Alice FOLDS THE LAUNDRY, how many APPLES does Bob have?
ALEX: (Starts fiddling with ROCKS) Hmm... 3 APPLES... carry the 1... the X APPLES cancels out the Y APPLES...
Meanwhile SAMMY: (Starts fiddling with ROCKS) Man, this is really hard. I'm struggling so much. I sure wish I studied instead of playing LEGO fortnite.
TEACHER: Alex, do you have the answer yet? It's a very simple question.
ALEX: Uhhh is it... NUMBER APPLES?
TEACHER: No, that's... incorrect.
ALEX: I think my ROCKS is not working properly.
SAMMY: (Raising hand) Oooh ooh! The answer is... 5!
TEACHER: That's right! You get a GOLD STAR! (Give SAMMY a GOLD STAR)
SAMMY: Yaaaaay!
TEACHER: See, Alex? With enough hard work and elbow grease, ROCKS is perfectly suited for complex GEOGRAPHY problems.
SAMMY: (Teasing ALEX) In your face you DELINQUENT!
TEACHER: (Noticing something suspicious under SAMMY) Wait a second.... is that....? What's that under your seat?
SAMMY: (Panicking, nervous) Oh, that? That's nothing...! Just my... other ROCKS!
TEACHER: (Retrieving item from under SAMMY) Is this a TI-84 CALCULATOR?
SAMMY: What???? How did that get there? That's crazy.
ALEX: That's no fair! One TI-84 CALCULATOR is about as powerful as ... (Typing on ROCKS) over 50 ROCKS!
TEACHER: Sammy, did you bring enough TI-84 CALCULATOR for the entire class?
SAMMY: (Sad) No....
TEACHER: I'm taking away your GOLD STAR. (Take GOLD STAR back from SAMMY)
SAMMY: Nooooo!
TEACHER: How much did this TI-84 CALCULATOR cost?
SAMMY: I don't know, I stole it from a kid who goes to Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs.
TEACHER: Well here's what I think about your new-fangled technology. (Smash TI-84 CALCULATOR on the floor)

CREATOR: (Enter the stage) Greetings, Investors!
CREATOR: I'm the CEO and Founder of COMPANY.
CREATOR: So, we have all been there, you ever just PROBLEM1, PROBLEM2, and many other problems you might have.
CREATOR: Does these problems annoy you so much you want to get rid of them?
INV1: Yeah, it really bothers me so much.
INV2: Yes.
CREATOR: If only there's someone who are helpful enough to fix these problems for you...
CREATOR: So here at COMPANY, we just found an innovative way and crafted the product that can help you live in peace knowing someone's with you.
CREATOR: Introducing… (Gesture toward the door, waiting)
PRODUCT: (Enter the stage and stand alongside CREATOR)
CREATOR: PRODNAME.
INV1: Wait... Isn't it just… a person?
CREATOR: Yes, it technically is.
CREATOR: But PRODNAME can do all the annoying problems solved for you in any way they can possibly think of.
INV2: Can I use it as a roommate?
CREATOR: Absolutely! You can do anything you want with PRODNAME. Anything.
INV1: But... can it speak just like any other avatar?
CREATOR: It does. (Look at PRODNAME) Hey, PRODNAME!
PRODUCT: PRODTALK
INV1: Oh, so it's technically a person then.
CREATOR: The secret behind is that PRODNAME uses machine learning technology powered by it's own processor, V1 chip…
CREATOR: …to do anything like FEATURES, etc.
PRODUCT: There are tons of other features I can do for you that I can't fit in this show.
INV2: Is it available for purchase yet?
CREATOR: Unfortunately, it's still in production, with deliveries planned in batches in the near future.
CREATOR: And, you can buy PRODNAME for a small price of PRICE.
shark tank discussion music 1
INV1: So, we have already found some flaws as you're talking about PRODNAME.
INV1: Is it actually designed for use in extreme activities, such as using it to work in a job and give you salary they earned?
CREATOR: We actually thought of that, and, because it's only designed for use at home, we made it so that none of these extreme activities will be worked with PRODNAME.
CREATOR: We also have a NUMBER-page safety instruction manual included if you buy one.
INV2: Can I use it as a mentor to teach my children?
CREATOR: If only it's your problem, then yes.
CREATOR: Keep in mind, PRODNAME can only solve YOUR problems for you, not someone else's problem. You can think of it as your personal roomate.
INV1: What if PRODNAME suddenly stops working?
CREATOR: That is why there's a 7 day battery life so you don't have to charge it often.
INV2: But I'm afraid the charging time would take hours since it has a big battery...
CREATOR: THAT is also why we managed to achieve charging time when charging to 80% to be less than 1 hour.
INV2: Looks like we have nothing else to doubt. I'm impressed you actually thought way beyond and created a product with all that in mind.
INV1: Yeah, I'm impressed too, you're a genius! Anyway, what do you ask for an investment?
CREATOR: We plan to roll out software updates and potentially an enhanced version of PRODNAME,
CREATOR: so we're looking for an investment of ASKMONEY dollars.

GUAR: (Startled out of chair) Wh-what’s going on!? Sir LACELOT ?!
Meanwhile KNIG: (Run to the locker in the corner) The King’s JEWEL you fool! The crown JEWEL! The very thing you’re guarding!
ARCH: A thief entered the castle! The lookout gave the alert!
GUAR: A thief!
KNIG: (Pull out the JEWEL from the locker) Oof… The JEWEL are safe.
ARCH: You were slacking off again, weren’t you
GUAR: Wha- pfff no! I was. I was inspecting the inside of my eyelids…
KNIG: (slap the guard on the back of the head) You twit! With your presence of mind that thief could steal the whole castle before you noticed!
Meanwhile GUAR: (The Knight hits you) Ouch!
WIZ: (appear in the doorframe) I’m afraid things are much worse that you say Sir LACELOT.
KNIG: Grand Wizard HARRY ! What brings you down from your tower!
WIZ: Are the JEWEL safe?
KNIG: Well, yes, but- Wait, what do you mean, much worse?
WIZ: The hour is dire. I was in the middle of concocting my new MAGIC1 potion.
WIZ: I was dosing the correct amount of RAT to add, when suddenly the lookout’s call startled me and I added too much.
WIZ: Upset, I decided I’d go give him a piece of my mind about yelling at such hours.
ARCH: Get to the point!

ARCH: (Look at the guard mockingly) Honestly, don't you know anything...
GUAR: Ooooh
WIZ: Indeed and every time a SHAPE changes, it leaves behind GREEN GOO !
WIZ: (examine the GOO ) which coincidentally could prove most useful for the development of a MAGIC2 potion.
WIZ: (To yourself) Maybe with an ounce of EYE and heated up a bit.
KNIG: (annoyed) Your point, Grand Wizard HARRY .
WIZ: My point!? (close the door, then look back at the others)
WIZ: Well tell me, Sir LACELOT ? Did you happen to see any SHAPE s?
KNIG: No?

ARCH: uuh no?
WIZ: And you guard! Did you see any SHAPE s!

WIZ: By Merlin’s beard, do you not realize, it could be in this very room! Hiding among us, waiting for suspicion to fall and snatch the JEWEL
WIZ: It could be anyone of us! It could be you! It could be me! It could be that chair! It could even be a magically levitating OBJECT for all we know!
Meanwhile GUAR: (make your way behind the wizard and raise your sword)
WIZ: (To yourself) Or maybe it’s waiting for us to turn on each other so it can steal the JEWEL unhindered?

TROLL: Troll had slow day today. Not many humans come to Troll's bridge anymore.
TROLL: Troll not even eaten any human BODYPART in weeks!
TROLL: Troll study to become JOB. Troll not even do that right. Troll always back to living under bridge. What Troll doing with life?
TROLL: (Sniff yourself) Yuck, Troll smell like SMELL! Troll need to clean.
TROLL: (Jump into the river facing the audience) Troll stay here until Troll not smell like SMELL anymore.
BELIEVER: (Enter stage right) Okay, so I got Amy to set the cameras up already, so we should be good to go. Oh, is your body camera on?
Meanwhile SKEPTIC: (Follow believer through stage right)
SKEPTIC: Yeah yeah, it's not like we're going to find anything, we never do.
BELIEVER: Shush! Let's be professional. Three, two, one...
Scary music
BELIEVER: (Look to the audience) Welcome back to SHOW, the best supernatural investigation show in the business!
BELIEVER: Last week we caught a CREATURE on camera at the nearby BUILDING!
SKEPTIC: Well, that's debatable...
BELIEVER: (Ignore skeptic) Anyway, this week we're deep in the forests of PLACE, hunting for the mysterious Troll said to lurk around this very bridge.
BELIEVER: They say this creature is known for its fierce teeth, gigantic stature, and the stench of SMELL!
Thunder
SKEPTIC: I mean, trolls don't exist, but this bridge does really stink of SMELL.
TROLL: (Climb back onto the bridge and face the investigators) Hey! That not nice. Troll wash self in river. Troll not smell like SMELL anymore!
BELIEVER: (Step back in awe at the sigh of the Troll) It can't be! Is that... The Troll of PLACE?!
SKEPTIC: Oh please, it's clearly just a really big ANIMAL.
Silly music 2
BELIEVER: (Point at skeptic) You always do this. You always try to explain everything away. What about the CREATURE we caught on camera last week at the BUILDING?
SKEPTIC: That CREATURE was NAME!
SKEPTIC: They just accidentally fell into some SUBSTANCE then rolled around in trash trying to get it off.
SKEPTIC: Then started to scream WEIRDTHING at the top of their lungs.
SKEPTIC: Sure it's weird, but it doesn't make them a CREATURE.
BELIEVER: Was it really NAME though? I don't buy it. Screaming WEIRDTHING is something that only a CREATURE would do!
BELIEVER: And it's known that trolls smell like SMELL, therefore this is a genuine troll! And it talks too!
SKEPTIC: Okay, listen, sure this ANIMAL talks, but think about it, parrots can talk, so it's not that much of a leap to say that a big ANIMAL could talk too.
SKEPTIC: And hey, maybe it'll scream WEIRDTHING too, who knows? But it's not a troll.
TROLL: Humans make too much noise. Make Troll's head hurt. Why you bother troll?
BELIEVER: (Excitedly talk to the Troll) Well, we're filming for our show, SHOW, we seek out supernatural creatures, much like yourself!
BELIEVER: So tell me, how long have you lived in the forests of PLACE?
TROLL: Well, Troll study to be JOB, but Troll no find work. No-one want to hire Troll.
TROLL: They say Troll smells too much like SMELL.
BELIEVER: Well, that's because you're a troll, right? Don't you all smell like that?
TROLL: No! Troll normally smell fine, not like SMELL at all!
SKEPTIC: For the record, I think you only smell that way because you're clearly a ANIMAL.
TROLL: (Frustrated) Why you call Troll ANIMAL? Humans are rude! Troll no do interview. Troll want to sit in river, not answer questions.
BELIEVER: Look what you did! You blew a perfect opportunity to learn more about the supernatural! I hope you're happy with yourself.
SKEPTIC: (Approach the Troll) Look, I didn't mean any disrespect, maybe I came off a bit harsh. I'm just tired is all.
SKEPTIC: I'm sure you'd make a great JOB, after a bit of a clean that is.
TROLL: Human really mean it?
SKEPTIC: Yeah, of course! And it's better to be a JOB than to do what we do.
SKEPTIC: My friend here drags me out to do these supernatural 'hunts' with him, it's always something completely explainable though.
TROLL: Wait. Humans want to hunt Troll? Troll easily crush humans!
TROLL: (Move toward the investigators aggressively) Troll crush humans right now, then eat human's BODYPART!
BELIEVER: (Step back in horror) No, not my BODYPART!
BELIEVER: (Run away through stage right) Quickly, let's get out of here! And make sure you bring all of the footage!
SKEPTIC: (Give the troll a can a deodorant) Hey man, I know you're not a troll, but you smell like one. Try this on, it's ANYTHING scented deodorant.
TROLL: (Take the deodorant, confused)
SKEPTIC: Anyway, I better go keep an eye on him in case he has another 'accident', he usually does when he's scared. (Exit stage right)
TROLL: (Sniff the deodorant) This ANYTHING deodorant smell bad, like human! Troll would rather smell like SMELL than like human!

RITA: You mean the one that says MESSAGE on it under a picture of IMAGE?
BRUCE: Yeah, that's the one!
RITA: You're wearing it already, dear.
BRUCE: (look down at your apron) Oh right! Anyway, where's Bobby? Our own son can't miss the neighborhood grillin' party!
RITA: I think he's out riding his MOUNT again.
BRUCE: (shake your head and laugh) That son of mine!
RITA: Dear, don't you think we have bigger things to worry about than your IMAGE apron and Bobby's unbreakable penchant for riding MOUNT?
BRUCE: Like what? It's a beautiful day outside! Birds are singing, flowers are blooming, and all the neighbors are coming over for an unforgettable luncheon!

VAMPIRE: (enter stage left) Bleh! Bleh! Hiss!
BRUCE: No way! Our new neighbor really is a vampire!
RITA: (hide behind BRUCE) Go get Bobby and his MOUNT inside, quick!

VAMPIRE: (spit something out, then wipe your mouth) Bleh, I hate these vegan BAKED from the church bake sale! But oh, all the profits go to CHARITY. Such a noble cause.
VAMPIRE: (look at BRUCE and RITA) Oh! Good morning, new neighbors! I do not believe we have been formally acquainted. (walk stage right, stop center stage)
RITA: Th-That's close enough! (run center stage, confront VAMPIRE) You can't come in our yard without being invited! That's vampire rules!
VAMPIRE: This is true, but you see, I have been invited. This party you are throwing, it is for the whole neighborhood. Hello, neighbor.
halloween music
BRUCE: But we didn't expect you to come! It's a bright sunny morning, so why aren't you burning?
VAMPIRE: Ah. The sunlight thing, it is a hurtful stereotype. We vampires are simply misunderstood. I can provide you with an educational pamphlet if you wish.
BRUCE: Really? I thought vampires were bloodthirsty monsters. That's what all the movies say, at least. Sorry about that, neighbor.
VAMPIRE: Slander, all of it. Throughout history, only one daughter of Adam has captured the truth of my kin in writing. She is called... Stephenie Meyer.
RITA: The lady who wrote Twilight?! You're telling me the true vampire mythos isn't Bram Stoker's Dracula? Nosferatu? Hell, I'd even take Buffy the Vampire Slayer!
VAMPIRE: Nope, Twilight. Anyway, I am NAME. In my tongue, it means blood letter, render of flesh, eater of souls! Oh, and I brought you some BAKED.
BRUCE: Ooo, I love BAKED! (take the treat from VAMPIRE)
RITA: Bruce! NAME literally just said their name means eater of souls!
BRUCE: Eater of souls? Haven't got any of those, so how about we make you eater of burgers? Come on over, neighbor!
VAMPIRE: Thank you. Admittedly, I do not have much of an appetite. I had a big breakfast, you see. Regardless, I would be glad to join your festivities.
VAMPIRE: (stand next to BRUCE) Ha. Your apron, it is humorous. To think one would wear a garment featuring IMAGE while cooking. How whimsical.
BRUCE: Well thanks, NAME! See, Rita honey? Someone who appreciates this apron can't be all bad!
RITA: Bruce, how can you be so accepting of a vampire?! Unless... (gasp) you're under their vampiric charms!
BRUCE: The only thing charming me is the smell of my world famous garlic burgers! (pause) Oh, and you, honey!
VAMPIRE: Nice save. (fistbump BRUCE)
Meanwhile BRUCE: (fistbump VAMPIRE)
RITA: Oh holy Father who art in heaven... (quietly pray to yourself)
BRUCE: Honey? Are you praying to DEITY?
VAMPIRE: Probably trying to repel me with holy power. I regret to inform you, neighbor, but prayer does not repel me. I am, in fact, in regular attendance of CHURCH.
RITA: If prayer won't work then... (sniff the air) Garlic burgers! That's it! (grab a burger off the grill) Ow ow ow, hot. (slap VAMPIRE across the face with burger)
VAMPIRE: How uncouth, to slap a new neighbor with your husband's flaming hot meat. I have half a mind to tell the Homeowner's Association about this.
RITA: But- But garlic is supposed to be your weakness! That's vampire rules!
VAMPIRE: I have already told you. Such silly folktales do not hold truth. Garlic, holy water, WEAKNESS -- they affect me not.
RITA: But we can't have a vampire at the neighborhood cookout! You're gonna suck all the steaks dry and your bats are gonna give the potato salad rabies!
BRUCE: Honey! Don't you think you're being a little... racist?
vine boom
sad chug jug music
RITA: I am? Oh my gosh, you're right... NAME, I'm so sorry. I really am a very accepting woman. It's just, well...
VAMPIRE: No, I understand. Everywhere I go, it is always the same. The people, they fear me. Perhaps I shall return to Transylvania... (sadly walk stage left)
RITA: No! NAME, please don't go! (stop VAMPIRE) Things will be different here! This is a very tolerant neighborhood.
VAMPIRE: But it is as you say. You thought I was a monster. Perhaps you still do. Aren't you afraid I'll ACTIVITY?
BRUCE: Nonsense, neighbor! Hey, I have a ADJECTIVE idea.
happy music 1
BRUCE: You can be this barbecue's guest of honor, and the whole neighborhood can get to know you!
RITA: Excellent idea, honey! We'll make it the NAME Welcoming Party! We'll have balloons and cake and all sorts of nice things!
VAMPIRE: Really? That is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
BRUCE: You just hang around, NAME, and we'll have a great time! (check your watch) Aha! The neighbors'll be here any minute!
RITA: Now if only Bobby and his MOUNT would get here! Oh, I'm sure our son would love to meet you, NAME!
VAMPIRE: Did you say your son was riding a MOUNT? Out in the middle of the neighborhood? On the corner of West and STREET, perhaps?
RITA: That's right!

ALIEN: From what I remember this is known as a food PUBLICSERVICE location.
CASHIER: Is there something I can help you find?
ALIEN: Perhaps you can tell me where I might locate a ARTIFACT?
CASHIER: I don't believe we carry any ARTIFACT's, let me check, I'll be right back... (move through stage left door)
ALIEN: Interesting... the overlords claimed that the humans would not be this forthcoming regarding their ARTIFACTs but it would appear they were ill-informed
CASHIER: (whisper) Hey Boss? We have a weirdo out there asking about ARTIFACT's and I have no idea what to tell them.
MANAGER: (whisper) They're asking about what? ARTIFACT's? We haven't carried those for years...
CASHIER: (whisper) What do you mean? We used to carry ARTIFACT's?
MANAGER: (whisper) Yeah, we used to get a lot of customers from out of town asking about them. I'll go see if I can smooth this over. (Walk out to register)
MANAGER: Hello, I hear you're looking for a specialty item?
ALIEN: I wouldn't consider a ARTIFACT to be a specialized item of any sort. They are quite common from my understanding.
MANAGER: Unfortunately we haven't stocked ARTIFACT's for quite a while now. Is there anything else we could help you with?
ALIEN: That is a rather disagreeable outcome indeed.
meanwhile CASHIER: (walk back to register)
MANAGER: Maybe you could find one still at the GASTATION down the road, they usually are the last to sell out.
meanwhile CASHIER: (walk back to register)
ALIEN: While I currently occupy this point in space time, might you have any SPACEWEAPONs or SHIPPARTs?
meanwhile CASHIER: (walk back to register)
MANAGER: I'm sorry but I don't believe we've ever stocked anything of that type here. Might have better luck at HARDWARESTORE though.
meanwhile CASHIER: (walk back to register)
CASHIER: You do know this is a grocery store right?
MANAGER: Shhhh... I'm sorry for their rudeness, they just started here.
MANAGER: (at cashier) How about you go organize the STOREITEMs in the back!
CASHIER: (walk off stage left) GAH!
MANAGER: Is there anything else I could help you with?
ALIEN: The only other provision that we require is a box of Fruit Stripe.
MANAGER: I'm sorry, they discontinued those a while ago.

Scary music
DOCTOR: In 3 days time, I, Doctor Maximus, on the eve of the founding of wretched LOCATION, shall finish development of the GIZMO!
DOCTOR: It will be child's play to arm it near the town hall as all gawk at the COOLTHING show!
DOCTOR: I will then use it to destroy the MONUMENT and conquer the world!
Music Stops
HENCHMENSM: Wait, boss, how does destroying the MONUMENT get you anywhere closer to conquering the world?
DOCTOR: (Gasp) You dare insult my intelligence?
HENCHMENPA: (Get in other henchmen's face) You insultin' boss over 'ere?
Groose music
HENCHMENSM: No no! I would never! I'm just... Admiring how your intelligence is so much greater! Could you walk me how you got there so I can be smarter?
DOCTOR: Well, I guess I can explain such a trivial logic to a ANIMAL brain like you...
Meanwhile HENCHMENPA: (Pull away from the other henchman.)
DOCTOR: First step! I use my massive amounts of wealth, gained due to how smart I am, in order to develop the advanced GIZMO.
HENCHMENSM: Didn't you inherit your wealth from your dad's VALUEABLE mine?
DOCTOR: I think you are just foolish and confusing me for an inferior specimen.
HENCHMENPA: (Whispering to other henchman) He did, just don't bring it up again.
DOCTOR: Now, if you'll stop being a ANIMAL brained, COOLTHING watcher, then we can continue.
HENCHMENSM: (sigh) Yes, boss.
DOCTOR: Now, step number two! We completely and utterly annihilate the MONUMENT in order to establish despair in the plebian masses.
HENCHMENSM: Got'cha, we cause fear then we take over the government quickly, right?
DOCTOR: Very. I will call them on my DEVICE and demand they surrender their power completely to me!
HENCHMENSM: Call the government in general, a random janitor, or the POSITION?
DOCTOR: Uh... I definitely thought that far... I will call...
HENCHMENPA: You go for the leader, boss. Call the POSITION.
DOCTOR: The POSITION!
HENCHMENSM: Even if the POSITION gives up and hands you the government, you don't have the support of the AGENCY.
DOCTOR: Why do I need the AGENCY? I have my henchmen and a secret lair base.
HENCHMENSM: Because the AGENCY has planes... And WEAPON... And will just force you out of the government.
DOCTOR: I'll make an omega-GIZMO, then there's no way they can stop me!
HENCHMENPA: You tell 'em, boss!
DOCTOR: (Facing the grunt who agrees with you) Thank you. You get a VALUEABLE.
HENCHMENPA: Thanks, boss!
HENCHMENSM: Look, doc, you have your wi-fi connected DEVICE, right?
DOCTOR: Of course I do! It is vital to every good doctor's kit.
HENCHMENPA: I have a DEVICE at home too.
HENCHMENSM: Doc... Literally every major corporation knows where you live, what you like to eat, and that you watch VIDEO.
DOCTOR: Better question, how do you know that?!
HENCHMENSM: You keep us up late at night playing VIDEO on loop.
DOCTOR: Maybe you should just watch it with me! They're meant for bonding!
HENCHMENSM: Look, let's say somehow you manage to take over LOCATION without a single hassle and you are in full control.
DOCTOR: A guarantee with my genius intellect.
HENCHMENSM: The neighbors of LOCATION see you have taken the government over unlawfully and want to conquer the world.
HENCHMENSM: All of them now want to kick you out. Do you know what the punishment for these things is?
DOCTOR: Exposure to awful... Awful amounts of COOLTHING.
HENCHMENSM: They punish you by PUNISHMENT. And you have it happen while a ANIMAL watches.
DOCTOR: (Gasp) There is no way they could do that to me!
Emotional piano music
HENCHMENSM: Look, boss, I genuinely love and care about you, but if you keep skipping steps, you're going to get hurt.
HENCHMENSM: You need to think more about the effects of WEAPON, the AGENCY, and generally how the POSITION will react.
DOCTOR: (Long pause.) I love you too, my dear minion. I will consider this.
HENCHMENSM: Thank you, now let's go get you some rest (start to lead the doctor stage right through the door).
DOCTOR: Thank you. I needed this... (Exit stage right with the minion).
Meanwhile HENCHMENPA: (Follow the doctor through the exit.)
Double bass music
TYPEWRITER: The MONUMENT was found at 20:35 to be utterly destroyed by an omega-GIZMO.

TEACHER: No Tessa, we've learned our lesson last time. We'll never do that again.
BILLY: Will we be practicing DESIRED_ACTIVITY? We loved doing that.
TEACHER: Oh Billy, too many parents complained, and we had to remove that from our curriculum.
TINY_TIM: Then what are we doing?
TEACHER: Ever since AI became humanity's OVERLORD in 2030 AD...
TEACHER: We've had "Machine Learning" sessions to help AI understand human nature.

Meanwhile ROBOT: (Speaking in Robotic voice) Hello, I have come to learn how to do the LEARNING_ACTIVITY.
TEACHER: Ah yes, LEARNING_ACTIVITY is a very complex subject.
TEACHER: Could you tell us what you know about LEARNING_ACTIVITY?
ROBOT: Of course.
ROBOT: I have learned that in order to perform the best "LEARNING_ACTIVITY".
ROBOT: I need to do it with a "DEPRESSING_PERSON", and to give it the "ILLEGAL_OBJECT".
ROBOT: Only then, will I be sufficient at the "LEARNING_ACTIVITY", and experience the "PLEASANT_SENSATION" as a result.
TEACHER: Very interesting. What advice do you have for our OVERLORD class?
BILLY: Our OVERLORD doesn't need to be good at LEARNING_ACTIVITY to be able to experience PLEASANT_SENSATION.
TESSA: What are you talking about? If you can't even do LEARNING_ACTIVITY right, you'll never be able to feel PLEASANT_SENSATION.
TINY_TIM: Yeah! Have you been living under a rock?
TEACHER: Now now kids, no need to fight in front of our OVERLORD.
TEACHER: AI can benefit from all kinds of opinions, no matter how INSULTING_ADJECTIVE they are.
BILLY: I'm not INSULTING_ADJECTIVE!
ROBOT: False. I can confirm that you are indeed, INSULTING_ADJECTIVE.

Meanwhile TINY_TIM: Ha-ha! Get good nerd, that's why I'm better at DESIRED_ACTIVITY than you!
TESSA: Guys, this isn't helping our OVERLORD...
TESSA: We need to give constructive feedback or we might endure PUNISHMENT.
TINY_TIM: My dad had to endure PUNISHMENT, he was a different man afterwards.
BILLY: I'm sorry OVERLORD, please don't make me endure PUNISHMENT.
ROBOT: No promises.
TINY_TIM: I bet our OVERLORD is great at LEARNING_ACTIVITY, he should feel PLEASANT_SENSATION all the time.
TESSA: Oh, oh, Teacher! I think some practice might be a good idea!
TESSA: Can we get a DEPRESSING_PERSON and some ILLEGAL_OBJECT for our OVERLORD to practice?
TEACHER: That's a great idea Tessa!
TEACHER: Tessa, go ahead an order a DEPRESSING_PERSON online.
TEACHER: I'm gonna look for the ILLEGAL_OBJECT I have stashed in my desk. (Rummage through desk to grab ILLEGAL_OBJECT)
TESSA: Yes, sir. (Pull out phone)
BILLY: You can order that online?
TINY_TIM: Duh, how else are people supposed to do LEARNING_ACTIVITY?
EXTRA: (Enter Stage Right) Did someone order a DEPRESSING_PERSON?
EXTRA: Please tell me you don't want me to do PREVIOUS_ACTIVITY.

ROBOT: Excellent.
EXTRA: Are you sure you want to do LEARNING_ACTIVITY with me though?
EXTRA: I'm sort of out of practice... And I've never done it with my OVERLORD before.
ROBOT: Don't you worry PET_NAME.
ROBOT: Come with me and we'll do the LEARNING_ACTIVITY.
ROBOT: We will feel the PLEASANT_SENSATION together.
EXTRA: (Exit Stage Right) I'll make sure you feel PLEASANT_SENSATION OVERLORD.
Meanwhile ROBOT: (Exit Stage Right)
TEACHER: Wow. I think I learned something today, didn't you class?
TESSA: Are you sure that wasn't all scripted just now?
TEACHER: Nonsense, our OVERLORD is just that good.
TEACHER: Anyways. I want all of you to practice LEARNING_ACTIVITY for homework today.
TEACHER: Make sure to record it, otherwise you will receive a missing grade.
TINY_TIM: Hell yeah! I'm gonna order a DEPRESSING_PERSON and some ILLEGAL_OBJECT right now!
BILLY: Nice! Can you share? We can practice our LEARNING_ACTIVITY together!

jazz music 1
TEACH: Good afternoon class, and welcome to Biology. Today we'll be discussing the UVULA.
TEACH: As you know, everybody has a UVULA, but did you know it has a secret function?
TEACH: Recent studies have shown that the UVULA can SEE in addition to its normal functions!
JIMMY: But Teach, I've known about that for years! I discovered my UVULA could do that when I was SKYDIVING!
TEACH: Well, Jimmy, that's very interesting, although not everyone in the class has DOCTORs for parents like you do.
TEACH: Plus, this was only recently added to the curriculum, so it's important for everyone to be aware of it.
TEACH: In fact, many DOCTORs discovered this years ago by accident, during a University of FRANCE study into the otherwise-unrelated LIVER.
TEACH: So, there are implications for that other area too.
CHLOE: Teach, I'm about to have that part of my body taken out in a couple of weeks, it's called a LIVER-ectomy.
CHLOE: Does that mean my UVULA will never SEE again?
TEACH: All I can say, Chloe, is that this was a very limited study, so there's always hope. Are there any other questions?
BEN: Teach, didn't PRINCE die because they had their LIVER removed?

CHLOE: (Whimper nervously)
JIMMY: Shut up Ben, you're scaring Chloe!
BEN: I'm just saying, it seems like a pretty CRITICAL body part to lose!
shark tank discussion music 1
TEACH: Settle down now! There are no silly questions.
TEACH: Although I would suggest, Ben, that you try to read the room before asking sensitive questions.
BEN: Sorry Teach. Sorry Chloe.
TEACH: And Jimmy, there'll be no rude language in my class, thank you, this isn't SUBJECT.
JIMMY: Sorry, Teach.
jazz music 1
TEACH: Chloe, PRINCE did have that operation, but that wasn't why they died.
TEACH: They died because of their addiction to GOLF, which I'm sure nobody in their right mind would ever get involved in, so don't worry.
CHLOE: (Wipe your brow) Phew!
TEACH: Anyway, the takeaway from this lesson is this.
TEACH: If you want to try getting your own UVULA to SEE, the best place to do it is at home.
TEACH: Just blitz a banana, a tomato and a FOODSTUFF in a blender, then drink the resulting smoothie.
Music Stops
BEN: Uh-oh... Teach, how long does that take to work?
TEACH: About half an hour, Ben.
BEN: Crap, those were the three things I had for lunch!
BEN: (Get up and run to the door) GANGWAY!
BEN: (Exit the stage while making a UVULA-related noise)

CON2: (walk over to podium 2) hello there (wave a bit)
HOST: These are our contestants for today (head over to host podium) Now let's bring in the volunteer.
VOL: (being dragged on stage) Let me out, please! I just want to leave. (goes to center stage)
HOST: (unfazed) Ah, it would seem that our volunteer needs another memory wipe.
meanwhile VOL: (whispers to self terrified) What is going on? Who are these people?
HOST: (in a deep voice waving hand in front of volunteer) MAGIC.
magic sound
HOST: Now that their mind is in the right place, let's get on with the game.
meanwhile VOL: (dazed and confused after memory wipe)
HOST: For this first scenario, our volunteer, let's call him NAME, just had a massive argument and fight with his wife and that led to him DESTROY her
HOST: Your goal is to convince them that he was either right in killing her or wrong. Max, you are first to go.
CON1: (joyfully) Thank you, Mr. Host. (walks over to the volunteer)
emotional piano music
CON1: NAME, you have to listen to me. You need to turn yourself in.
VOL: (snapping out of it now angry and panicking) Turn myself in? Are you crazy? I didn't do anything wrong.
CON1: NAME. You got into an argument with her and now she's dead.
VOL: That's not enough to accuse me of murder!
VOL: (pauses, visibly conflicted) I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
CON1: I know, NAME. But running away won't change anything.
VOL: (sighs and crying) Alright, fine, I'll turn myself in
Music Stops
Gameshow ding

(magic sound)
meanwhile VOL: (fall over, completely motionless)
HOST: Perfect. Now let's bring in our next contestant. Come on over here, uh, (looks down at hand) Reginal.
tense cinematic music
CON2: (walks up to the volunteer) NAME, my friend, why are you letting guilt weigh you down? You did what you had to do.
VOL: (waking up a little dazed but angry) What? I killed her, Reginal. I killed my wife!
CON2: She pushed you to the edge, and you defended yourself. It's as simple as that.
Music Stops
scary music
VOL: But it wasn't self-defense! We were arguing, and then... I DESTROY her. I lost control!
CON2: Control? NAME, control is an illusion. Embrace your impulses, your desires. Let me guide you.
VOL: (calming down) Guide me to what?
CON2: To power, NAME. To dominance. You've tasted it now. Don't you want more?
VOL: (eyes widening, slowly becoming crazy) Y-yeah, it did feel good, maybe your right
CON2: Exactly. And you can feel that rush again. Just imagine, NAME, the fear in their eyes, as you DESTROY them all
VOL: (nodding slowly) Yes... yes, I want that feeling again.
CON2: Then embrace it, NAME. Give in to your bloodlust. There's a whole world out there waiting for you to DESTROY
HOST: (running in between them, a little scared) OK, let's not do that.
HOST: (waves hands in front of the volunteer's face and in a deep voice) SPELL.

meanwhile CON1: (walk up to the volunteer)
epic fantasy music 2
VOL: (waking up acting like a child) I saw you near his room, Max! I know you did something!
CON1: (calm and reassuring) I was just checking on him, he's my friend too, remember?
VOL: No! You're lying! He's not moving, Max! I know you did something.
CON1: (getting a little stressed) Kid, listen to me. Let's go check on him together, okay? We'll see that he's just fine.
VOL: (even more angry) No! I don't trust you! I HATE YOU!
CON1: Please don't say that. I'm here to help.
Gameshow buzzer
HOST: Ooh, it would seem you've lost your client. Sadly, I'm going to need to take away your NUMBER points.
CON1: Dammit. (mumbling, walks back to podium 1) Stupid fricken kid.
HOST: (waves hands in front of the volunteer) SPELL. Well, onto (sighs) oh boy, contestant 2.
CON2: (walks up to the volunteer) why hello there
mystery music 1
VOL: (scared) W-who are you? What did you do to Andrew?
CON2: Heh, I never did anything, so why blame me?
CON2: You're his sister, you should be watching out for him too.
CON2: You know he's better off without you anyways.
meanwhile VOL: (beginning to tear up and cry)
CON2: (kneels down to the volunteer) You solely are responsible for this.
VOL: (Crying) Nooo!
HOST: (astonished) ... Wow, um, I don't know what to do now. Uh.
CON1: Are you serious? Isn't it obvious that he is cheating? I mean, how else would he beat me?
CON2: Oh, you think I'm cheating just because I have actual skill?
CON2: The only reason you're on here is because you suck up to that damn host, using your massive "personality" and your plastic face to get your way.
HOST: Alright, time to pull the plug on everything. (walks into the middle of the stage and in a deep voice) INCANTATION, INCANTATION (shouting) INCANTATION.
Music Stops

CON1: Augh why am i so sleepy suddenly (fall to the floor asleep)
CON2: Dammit i was about to win (slowly falls down to the floor asleep)
HOST: Welp, I'm sorry everyone in the audience this got really out of hand, but be sure to tune in next time to GAME.
meanwhile VOL: (falls to the floor dead)
HOST: (look down at the volunteer) Oh dear i think they're dead... I know i can just kidnap and brain wipe PLAYER

TEACH: (Enter stage left) Okay class, everyone gather round the back of the worktop with me.
TEACH: Today we've booked Billy Mays' kitchen instead of the classroom, because there's been another discovery at the University of FRANCE.
JIMMY: Is it a new element?
BEN: A cure for DIABETES?
CHLOE: Has MARKIPLIER finally written a book worth reading?
TEACH: Ben, you're closest. It's a new, ultra-quick WART remover!
TEACH: Observe. (Paint your finger with a nail brush, then hold it up for the class to see)
magic sound
JIMMY: Oooh!
Meanwhile CHLOE: Wow!
BEN: Uh-oh...
TEACH: This new discovery makes annoying little WARTs disappear!
TEACH: Now, I think it's best that you all learn how to make it, because it's so effective, as you can see.
JIMMY: How do you make it?
TEACH: It's easy, Jimmy. The DOCTORs at the University of FRANCE took three very simple compounds and mixed them together in a blender.
TEACH: However, unlike traditional WART remover, it doesn't require processing in a HEATER, so you can make it at home!
BEN: What are the ingredients?
TEACH: Well Ben, you need about a cupful of protium hydroxide, three tablespoons of sodium bicarbonate, and just a smidge of UNOBTAINIUM.
CHLOE: Wait a minute Teach, that's just water and baking powder, and everyone's got UNOBTAINIUM in their kitchen cupboard!
CHLOE: You're teaching us how to make batter for a FAIRY cake!
record scratch

TEACH: ...Who would have guessed that FAIRY cake batter could also be used as a super-effective WART remover?!
JIMMY: Not me!
Meanwhile BEN: Never would've guessed that...

TEACH: Well anyway, to the practical! I've lined up two of the ingredients on the worktop already, as you can see.
TEACH: And if you look in the oven, there's enough UNOBTAINIUM for two of you, but one of you will need to go into the back room to get yours.
JIMMY: (Touch your nose) Not it!
Meanwhile CHLOE: (Touch your nose) Not it!
BEN: (Disappointed, exit stage right) Awww...
CHLOE: (Open the oven and take something out, stand behind worktop) Got one. Hey, this is a pretty nice one.
Meanwhile JIMMY: (Take something out of the oven, close it and stand behind worktop) Me too.
TEACH: (Go to right door, call backstage) You okay Ben?
crashing debris
BEN: (Enter stage left, stand behind worktop) Yeah Teach, I found one!
CHLOE: What was that noise?
BEN: Someone left a HAZARD right in the middle of the floor and I tripped over it.
JIMMY: (To audience) Oh, I wonder how *that* got there!
TEACH: Settle down, now! Anyway, you've each got your ingredients, so let's get started. Ben, how about you go first?
BEN: (While putting ingredients in bowl) Okay, in goes the protium hydroxide, add the sodium bicarbonate...
BEN: And now just a smidge of UNOBTAINIUM... (add way too much of the stuff)

TEACH: Right, get a bit on that paintbrush and lightly dab it on Ben's WART.
JIMMY: Can't really see it... must be a tiny little thing.
JIMMY: I'll just paint the whole SHOULDER, I'm bound to get it! (Paint Ben's entire SHOULDER)

Meanwhile JIMMY: (Go back behind the worktop)
TEACH: (Pour a bucket of liquid over Ben) Hold still Ben, this will help!
Meanwhile BEN: (Stop scratching, splutter)
TEACH: This is why we always keep a bucket of COLA on hand.
TEACH: This formula very much depends on how ripe the UNOBTAINIUM is, otherwise you get the world's strongest itching powder!
BEN: (Wipe your eyes) You could've told me! And that was one from the oven... (gasp) oh no, Chloe's next!
TEACH: (Go back behind the worktop) Well anyway, looks like Chloe's the only one left, why don't you have a go?
CHLOE: (Mix everything together) Water and sodium bicarbonate, in a bowl, mix it up, add the UNOBTAINIUM...
Meanwhile BEN: Can't we just use your batch, Teach?
CHLOE: Done. Just like cooking with Grandma.
TEACH: Okay, take the paintbrush, and listen, it's just a dab of the stuff on his WART this time.
CHLOE: Just a dab... (Lightly dab Ben's SHOULDER with the paintbrush)

TEACH: Good afternoon class, welcome to Physics. Today we've got a very special lesson planned for you.
TEACH: You all saw the news last night on Channel 4, didn't you?
BEN: About PRINCE and their partner's breakup? I could see that coming a mile off.
TEACH: ...No Ben, I said Channel 4, not FOX (finger quotes) 'News'.
JIMMY: About NASA's new Moon rocket?
TEACH: That's not what I had in mind Jimmy, but yes, very exciting nonetheless.
CHLOE: You're talking about the University of FRANCE's discovery of time travel, aren't you?
TEACH: Precisely. Today we'll learn about sending objects forward through time.
TEACH: Now, since the school budget isn't big enough for a proper time machine...
TEACH: (Lift the time machine from under the desk and put it on top) We'll need to improvise for today's demonstration.
CHLOE: Oooooh!
Meanwhile Ben: Wooooow!
JIMMY: What can we send, Teach?
TEACH: Whatever will fit inside this MICROWAVE, about the size of a MATCHBOX.
BEN: Can we send the class hamster?
TEACH: No Ben, time travel is far too dangerous for living things, even PRINCE.
JIMMY: Can we send this? (Hold up your hand)
record scratch
music stops
TEACH: Give me that. Now.
JIMMY: (Hand it over) But Teach, it's just a CUCUMBER!
TEACH: I'll let it slide because we can use it for the demo. You'll get this back at the end of class.
JIMMY: (Go back to your seat) (To others) What did I do?
jazz music 1
CHLOE: The news said the FRANCE scientists used an ANTIMATTER condenser. Do we have one, Teach?
TEACH: Nah, just an ordinary air fryer will do. It's the same technology, after all.
JIMMY: Why is the MICROWAVE upside-down?
TEACH: It reverses the electricity, otherwise everything on the outside gets sent instead.
TEACH: Uh, Ben, you're closest, would you please go and plug the air fryer in for me?
CHLOE: Are you sure it's a good idea to let Ben do that?
Meanwhile BEN: (Grab the plug, plug it in by the door, then go back to your desk)
TEACH: Relax Chloe, only someone who can't tell his backside from his ELBOWs could do that wrong!
CHLOE: (To audience) That's what I mean...
BEN: All set!
TEACH: (Beckon everybody up to the desk) Okay, everybody gather round.
Meanwhile CHLOE: (Stand up, but don't go to the desk)
TEACH: Let's put the CUCUMBER in the MICROWAVE and set it for about...
TEACH: TEN minutes forwards. Come on Chloe, don't be shy.
CHLOE: (Slowly back towards the door) I'm... fine, thank you Teach.
TEACH: Suit yourself. Okay, everybody ready?
BEN: I'll turn on the air fryer!
JIMMY: And I'll press the button on the MICROWAVE!

JIMMY: Huh? We haven't moved!
CHLOE: (Point above the door) Look at the clock!
TEACH: (Facepalm) Oh, crap...
CHLOE: You've been gone TEN hours, not TEN minutes! School's finished!
CHLOE: Ben plugged the air fryer in upside-down! I *so* warned you!
BEN: Whoops...
CHLOE: That thing's been running at full tilt all day!
JIMMY: Sorry...
CHLOE: The electricity's cost school more than PRINCE earns in a week!
TEACH: That's the budget blown for the rest of the year...
CHLOE: I was questioned by the *police* over how you three went missing!
CHLOE: And the worst part? It took so long that I missed the grand final of GLADIATORS on FOX!
CHLOE: God! (Storm offstage, slamming the door behind you)

JIMMY: Well, I guess I'll have my CUCUMBER back then. Does this mean class is dismissed?
TEACH: Yes, I think so. (Upbeat) But at least we've discovered time travel is safe for living things after all!
JIMMY: Great! (Exit stage right)
TEACH: So I'll type up my findings, send them off to the University of FRANCE, and see you lot tomorrow... or later on this morning... or after Christmas?
BEN: Yeah, it's no use us sitting around on our ELBOWs all night. (Exit stage right)
TEACH: (Look at your watch) TEN hours?! Jeez...

NARRATOR: Oh, hello all you wonderful NAME. Glad you could join me for story time.
NARRATOR: Tonight, I'm going to tell you the tale of how a family's Christmas almost got ruined.
NARRATOR: So sit back, grab your SNACK, and make yourself cozy in your favorite blanket. (ahem)
Music stops
Christmas music 2
NARRATOR: 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a MOUSE.
NARRATOR: The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there.
NARRATOR: And by their hopes, their wish came true, as down came ol' Santa, down the chimney, coming through.
Meanwhile SANTA: (Enter stage from above backstage ladder) Ho ho ho!
NARRATOR: He dusts himself off, all covered in soot. He paid good money for that suit, from his head to his foot!
Meanwhile SANTA: (Dust yourself off)
NARRATOR: He looks around the house, impressed by the décor.
SANTA: Why can't my place look like this? It's such a bore!
NARRATOR: He looks around with his sack of gifts to bequeath, before finding a Christmas tree with presents underneath!
Meanwhile SANTA: (Walk to the bookshelf, pretend there's a tree here)
SANTA: Ohoho, what a magnificent tree. I just wish they would leave the present-setting to me.
NARRATOR: So he lays out the presents, each layered one-by-one, and as quickly as he started, he was already done.
Meanwhile SANTA: (Start placing presents by the tree)
NARRATOR: On a plate on the table, waiting for Santa to be seaten, was some MILK, ready to be eaten.
SANTA: Oh boy, MILK! This is my favorite!
NARRATOR: So he took a bite out of it, but there's no time to savor it. Santa Claus grimaces, as he has come to have learnt,
SANTA: This MILK taste a little burnt...
NARRATOR: So with presents delivered and MILK ate, it was time for him to go, or else he would be late.
NARRATOR: But as he walked by the Christmas tree so sneakily, he trips over the rug, landing with a thud, groaning weakly.
Meanwhile SANTA: (Trip and fall over the rug)
Music stops
Courtroom sting
NARRATOR: Not missing a beat, he gets back onto his feet. He made a lot of noise, enough to wake up the girls and boys.
NARRATOR: So with a honk of his NOSE, and a chant of his spell,
SANTA: SPELL!
Magic sound
Teleport SANTA to Backstage
NARRATOR: he slinks back up the chimney, leaving everything well.
NARRATOR: ... well, almost everything.
Christmas music 1
NARRATOR: As the family rises, so too does the sun, as the little boy rushes in, ready for some fun!
Meanwhile TOM: (Enter Stage Left, pretend there's a tree by the bookshelf)
NARRATOR: But as the mother enters too, they both can see, the Christmas tree has nothing under it, it's empty!
Meanwhile SUNNY: (Enter Stage Left, pretend there's a tree by the bookshelf)
TOM: (sadly) Mommy, where are the presents...?
SUNNY: (surprised) Oh, I... I don't know, honey. Maybe Santa saw something wrong with them, and took them back to his place to FIX them.
NARRATOR: As the kid kneels by the tree, it tremors and trembles, before standing up tall, going completely mental!
Music stops
Tense cinematic music
Teleport TREE to Center Stage
TREE: (roar, angry) Raaaargh!
TOM: (scared) Aaah! Mommy, the Christmas tree is alive!
TREE: Raargh, I'm the evil tree of Christmas revenge!
NARRATOR: The tree is alive, and ready to brawl-
TREE: (look at the narrator) Hey disembodied voice! Stop with the narrating! It's making me feel ANGRY!
NARRATOR: ... oh, and it can apparently break the fourth wall.
TREE: (look back at the others) Now then... I ate all your presents, and now I'm gonna eat you!
SUNNY: But sir- ma'am- ugh, tree, how are you even alive?
TREE: Heh, wouldn't you like to know?
SUNNY: I... yes, I would. That's why I asked.
TREE: Oh, a wise girl, are ya?
TREE: Well, for your information, Santa tripped over your ADJ rug last night, and spilled his magic DUST all over me, bringing me to life.
SUNNY: He's real...? I- I mean... why are you so angry then?
TREE: I'm angry... because you never sing "O Christmas Tree!" And now you're gonna pay!
TOM: No, I won't let you hurt mommy!
SUNNY: Tomothy, no!
TOM: (Punch or kick the tree) FIGHT!
Crashing debris
TREE: (In pain) Ooooww...! Right in the ornaments...!
TREE: (Vomit and die)
Music stops
NARRATOR: The Christmas tree pukes up all of the Christmas presents, and lays on the floor defeated. What an odd turn of events.
NARRATOR: Having just woken up, she's too tired to question it. The mother opens the front door, and drags the Christmas tree outside to the curb, no longer fit.
SUNNY: (Open front door, stage right) Get out of here, you tree. (Drag the tree off stage)
Meanwhile TREE: (get dragged off stage)
TOM: Come on Mommy, come on, let's open the presents!
SUNNY: (chuckle) Alright, Tomothy, I'm coming. Next year, though, let's try to get something that can't kill us.
Christmas music 3
NARRATOR: So with blood rushing and everyone awake, they begin opening their presents, ignoring the tree for their own sake.
NARRATOR: Now, let's hope this never happens again, because it was such a fright!
NARRATOR: Merry Christmas to all, and to all... well, you know the rest.

EZEKIEL: (bangs gavel) Good afternoon. I am Your Honorable Ezekiel, presiding over the case of VILLAGE vs Agatha.
EZEKIEL: Agatha, you stand accused by the citizens of VILLAGE due multiple instances of suspected witchcraft.
ABIGAIL: (pointing accusingly) I saw her, Your Honor! She was dancing in the moonlight, chanting strange incantations!
Music Stops
EZEKIEL: And what evidence do you have, Abigail?
ABIGAIL: (excitedly) She was carrying a CAULDRON, Your Honor! A CAULDRON!
PRUDENCE: (to Ezekiel) I always suspected Agatha. She's always been a bit too fond of HERBS, if you ask me.
EZEKIEL: Very well. Agatha, do you deny these accusations?
AGATHA: (nervously) I do, Your Honor. I swear, I was merely collecting HERBS for my potions. I mean, REMEDIES.
ABIGAIL: POTION MAKER! She admits it!
EZEKIEL: Silence, Abigail! Let the accused speak.
PRUDENCE: But what about the MUSHROOMS, Ezekiel? I heard she was brewing potions with MUSHROOMS!
EZEKIEL: (curious) Is this true, Agatha?
AGATHA: (frustrated) They're not for potions! They're for my vegan MUSHROOMS stew! I'm a herbalist, not a witch!

ABIGAIL: (scoffing) A likely story! Everyone knows witches use MUSHROOMS!
EZEKIEL: (stroking his chin) Indeed, MUSHROOMS are commonly associated with witchcraft.
PRUDENCE: See, I told you!
AGATHA: (desperately) Your Honor, I swear on all that is HOLY, I'm innocent! I just have a passion for plants and a distaste for MEAT!
EZEKIEL: (thoughtfully) Very well. We shall adjourn for now and reconvene after lunch to deliberate.
TYPEWRITER: Two Hours at FRANCHISE Later
EZEKIEL: (addressing the courtroom) After two hours of careful consideration, and a combo meal at FRANCHISE, we have reached a verdict.
ABIGAIL: (eagerly) Guilty! She's guilty!
PRUDENCE: (nodding vigorously) Burn the witch!
EZEKIEL: (raising his hand for silence) However, upon further investigation,
EZEKIEL: it has become clear that Agatha's actions were not rooted in witchcraft, but rather in her dietary choices.
AGATHA: (hopeful) So you believe me, Your Honor?
EZEKIEL: Yes, Agatha. It is evident that you are not a witch, but simply a vegan herbalist.
ABIGAIL: (deflated) But... but what about the CAULDRON and the Incantations?
AGATHA: (smirking) The CAULDRON was for my vegetable stew, and the Incantations were just me singing to my plants.
PRUDENCE: (Embarrassed) Oh... I see.
EZEKIEL: (clearing his throat) In light of this revelation, Agatha is free to go. Case dismissed.

COWBOY: EXCLAMATION! That there's the 11 o'clock bell, which means I'm late for my date! I've gotta mosey on outta here!
KEITH: You've got a date at 11 in the morning?
COWBOY: Let's just say It's a special kind of date, the kind ya pay for by the hour. (point to the saloon)
COWBOY: I've got some quality time with GNAME, the finest girl in the saloon! I'm gonna be ACTIVITY with her real good! I hate to ask, but can you folks watch HNAME?
KEITH: We'd love to! (get hit by Laura) Ouch, that smarts. (rub where you got hit)
Meanwhile LAURA: Hell no. (hit Keith again)
COWBOY: Great! HNAME, be nice and let these PLACE folk ride ya 'round if'n they so desire. Adios for now! (exit stage right)
KEITH: CNAME, GNAME, June 17th 1876... Why does this all sound so familiar? I swear I've read about this before. (pull out phone) I'll Google it. Oh wait, no wi-fi.
LAURA: Great, now we're stuck playing babysitter for some stupid horse. Gosh I wish we were back in the present day, watching MODERN.
HORSE: I don't take kindly to being called stupid, Miss Laura.
LAURA: A talking horse?!
HORSE: Indeed. I've only revealed myself to you because you're obviously time travelers. I, too, am not from this time period.
LAURA: A talking, time-traveling horse named HNAME? I don't believe it. Are you part robot too?
KEITH: I'm just as shocked as you, honey. What can we do for you, HNAME? If you want, we can take you back to the future with us.
HORSE: No no, I'm quite comfortable here in 1876. CNAME treats me with dignity and respect, and I just love how the air smells of SMELL.
LAURA: What a weird horse.
KEITH: So why did you travel to this particular time then, HNAME?
HORSE: To put a stop to ONAME, the most fearsome outlaw in all the Wild West.

HORSE: In just a moment, ONAME is going to rob the old general store, ignite a bundle of dynamite, and blow up the ol' saloon. Well, I won't stand for it.
LAURA: You're very brave, HNAME. Anything we can do to help?
HORSE: Just stand back and watch. I've planned this whole encounter out.
gunshot
HORSE: Here he comes! Exactly as I planned, he just shot the general store owner.
LAURA: Couldn't you have stopped him before he gunned a man down?

OUTLAW: (enter stage left) Well howdy doody, folks of TOWN! It's me, ONAME, and I'm here to do some real mean outlaw stuff, like CRIME!
HORSE: Not so fast, ONAME. (meet OUTLAW at center stage)
OUTLAW: What in the God damn? A walkin', talkin' horse? (meet HORSE at center stage)
HORSE: That's right, ONAME. You can call me Sheriff HNAME. I'ma callin' you out, you no-good outlaw. Put down that dynamite and duel me.
OUTLAW: EXCLAMATION, I sure wasn't expectin' no sharpshootin' horse. Fine! (drop dynamite) 10 paces and we draw, unless you're chicken.
HORSE: On the contrary, ONAME. I'm a horse. Now get to walkin'. (turn around and start walking stage right)
OUTLAW: (turn and walk stage left) 1! 2! 3!
Meanwhile HORSE: 1! 2! 3!
KEITH: HNAME, I hate to ask, but do you even have a gun? How do you plan to shoot ONAME?
HORSE: (keep walking) 4! 5! 6! (to KEITH) It's in my saddle bag. As for how to shoot it, I... hadn't considered that.
LAURA: But if you can't shoot your gun, ONAME will win by default! I thought you planned this all out!
KEITH: I'll go get CNAME! He had a gun, right? There's still time!
HORSE: No, I can hear him with my incredible horse hearing. He's still ACTIVITY with GNAME. You'll never get to him in time. You'll have to take the shot for me.
KEITH: Ok! (grab the gun from HORSE's saddle bag and shoot OUTLAW in the back)
gunshot
OUTLAW: What in tarnation..? (fall over dead)
HORSE: That... wasn't exactly fair, but I suppose results are results. ONAME, the feared outlaw of the west, is dead. TOWN is saved.

ALICE: (Pouring wine) Welcome, everyone, to my humble ABODE. I'm so glad you could make it.
BOB: I hope y'all came with an appetite or an excuse to drink, I'm breaking out the good WINE tonight.
CLAIRE: (Nervously) Um, you don't have to do that. We stopped by STORE on the way here and brought our favorite DRINK.
DAVID: We couldn't just show up without contributing to the festivities.
EMMA: (Sipping champagne) Good thing you did, it would have been embarrassing for you if you did.
EMMA: Yeah, why with the sudden celebration? We haven't heard from you lately. I thought you isolated yourselves again.
BOB: Now now Emma, I just happened to have some good MEAT and Alice thought it would be a good idea to share.
CLAIRE: Is there...something I'm missing?
DAVID: (Chuckles) Emma just being Emma, she's not afraid to call you out when you deserve it. .
ALICE: Emma, perhaps you shouldn't ask questions you don't want the answers to.
BOB: (Standing Between Alice and Emma) Hey, no need to be TOXIC. Why don't we just enjoy tonight?
Music Stops
EMMA: Oh I plan to (Walks to other side of room).
ALICE: (Mysteriously) I hope you do.
TYPEWRITER: Three hours and many glasses of WINE later.
BOB: Then I asked him, what do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!

EMMA: It's probably the booze (Hiccup) but is Bob actually funny?
DAVID: (chuckling) Oh definitely, that was TERRIBLE.
ALICE: Yet I still keep him around.
CLAIRE: (Chuckling tipsy) Alice, I do want to thank you for inviting us,
DAVID: Yeah, I know we haven't been on the best terms as of late. We had to take a step back after....
ALICE: It's fine. We totally get it. But how about one more to wrap up this soiree?
DAVID: We really should be going.
ALICE: Can I get everyone's attention?
ALICE: I'd like to thank you for coming, it truly has been an...insightful night. However, I can't keep up this farce any longer.
CLAIRE: Wait, what?
EMMA: Oh, finally this night is getting interesting.
ALICE: I've been eagerly waiting for the right time to do this. (pulls out a small vial of CHEMICAL from her pocket.)
ALICE: You see, while you were all being chummy and enjoying everyone's company, I've been spiking the WINE with CHEMICAL.

EMMA: What?!
BOB: This WINE? (Holds up his glass)
CLAIRE: Why would you do this?
EMMA: We didn't do anything to you?
ALICE: See Emma, that's where you're wrong.
EMMA: ...What?
ALICE: Remember FIRSTLOVE? He was my everything. We laughed, loved, and appreciated every moment with each other.
ALICE: But you had to take FIRSTLOVE away from me!
EMMA: But Alice, you ran over his RELATIVE with your CAR. You just got out of jail last year.
ALICE: (Irrational) I loved him! So now you must reap what you sow.
CLAIRE: Okay well Emma might deserve it, but David and I didn't do anything!
ALICE: Well...to put it in simple terms so you understand. I don't like you Claire. I wish I could never see your face again.
CLAIRE: (Gasps) Well I....
ALICE: However, I needed David to sell this idea of a party. His vibes are immaculate. (Fist bumps David)
DAVID: (Fist bumps Alice) Hell yeah.
DAVID: (To Claire Shrugging) What?
ALICE: Now I hope you had plenty to drink tonight...because now it's my turn to celebrate!
ALICE: (drinks from her glass, then collapses onto the floor.)
BOB: (Panicking) Alice! Why would you do this?!
CLAIRE: (Sobbing) I knew this was a bad idea!
DAVID: (Chuckling) This took a dark turn.
EMMA: And I didn't even get to finish my champagne.
BOB: (Slaps Alice) Wake up, Alice!
CLAIRE: We need to call an ambulance!
DAVID: I'll call 911! (dials 911)
CLAIRE: Bob, she's going to be okay. She'll have to go to jail again.
BOB: (Sobbing) It'll be her third strike...First CRIME, then FIRSTLOVE, now this?
EMMA: I might as well get another drink, I know where the good stuff is.(casually pours herself another glass of champagne.)
DAVID: (On the phone) Yes, we need an ambulance. Someone has collapsed!

CAPO: Not quite the answer, bub.
COP: The boss deals with ACTIVITY.
CAPO: That's the answer were lookin for.
(noir music 1)
MOB BOSS: If I let you two into my family, do you pledge your loyalty?
ROOKIE: (nervous) I pledge my entire loyalty! I wanna really be a part of this family b-boss!
ROOKIE: I have been apart of BUISNESS after all!
COP: I would give up my life for this life boss!
MOB BOSS: Are you both sure? This line of work is hard.
ROOKIE: (nervous) I-I don't know s-sir! I haven't used a WEAPON before.
COP: I know I could, I have used a WEAPON before, not sure about with ACTIVITY though.
MOB BOSS: Well you see, I need loyal people in my family, otherwise, we might have problems.
MOB BOSS: But as for the ACTIVITY, It's necessary for my BUISNESS.
MOB BOSS: Without my BUISNESS I wouldn't have money.
CAPO: Trust me when the boss doesn't get his money, it isn't pretty.
MOB BOSS: That's why I trust NAME here with my life.
CAPO: Yeah just last week we had to take care of what was his name boss?
MOB BOSS: He was Fat Tony right NAME?
CAPO: Yeah that was him, I recall you had me take a squad out to perform a PUNISHMENT for him.
MOB BOSS: Just because he was nothin but a dirty filthy ANIMAL.
ROOKIE: I'm very sure! of that!
COP: I remember hearing that in the paper's when that happened.
MOB BOSS: You know what NAME? give em a test run, lets see if they can handle it.
(music stops)
CAPO: You got it boss man, you heard him get goin!
ROOKIE: O-okay! (exit stage left)
COP: I'm ready for this boss (exit stage left)
MOB BOSS: Hey, NAME before you go,
CAPO: Yeah boss?
MOB BOSS: (whispering) Keep a close eye, I think one of em is a dirty ANIMAL.
MOB BOSS: If need be you might have to use your WEAPON later.
CAPO: You got it boss! (exit stage left)

CAPO: (enter stage left) Were back boss, Hey! get in here you two!
ROOKIE: (enter stage left) Di-did we just commit ACTIVITY??!

ROOKIE: W-well there was so much FLUID everywhere and so many d-dead!
CAPO: (approach ROOKIE) Well bub, straighten up cus you'll need to man up for this work.
ROOKIE: Y-yes sir.
MOB BOSS: Well NAME how did they perform?
(dark classical music)
CAPO: Well as you can see here this one was nervous as a wreck however.
CAPO: (approach COP) This one did the ACTIVITY wonderful.
MOB BOSS: Hmmm, I see. Now I think NAME, we shall decide who is fit for the family.
CAPO: I agree boss, I think I know exactly who it might be though.
MOB BOSS: For the final question, and lets do this one at a time.
MOB BOSS: (approach ROOKIE) If there was a dirty ANIMAL in our midst what would you do?
ROOKIE: U-uhm, I would tell you bo-boss!
MOB BOSS: Even if it was your own family?
ROOKIE: (nervous) Y-yes I would!
MOB BOSS: Alright.
MOB BOSS: (approach COP) Same question for you.
MOB BOSS: If there was a dirty ANIMAL in our midst what would you do?
COP: (scoff) Well that's easy I would use my WEAPON to dispose of them and then report it to you boss man!
MOB BOSS: Even if they were family?
COP: Yeah I would, because you have to be loyal to be in the family.
COP: Unlike that one who's nervous as hell, I can use any WEAPON, for your ACTIVITY to help your BUISNESS grow.
MOB BOSS: Good answers from both of you.
MOB BOSS: This will be the final test.
CAPO: There is currently a dirty ANIMAL among us right now. Who is it? (load gun)
CAPO: (approach ROOKIE) Is it you? Are you the dirty ANIMAL?
ROOKIE: W-what!?! No it's not me!! I have been loyal and working for the bosses BUISNESS for years!!!
CAPO: (approach COP) Then could it be you? Are you the filthy ANIMAL?
COP: No sir, I proved myself when we went to do that ACTIVITY just now
COP: (points to ROOKIE) But I think it's him, he has shown that he's extremely nervous this whole time.
COP: Any normal employee for the boss from BUISNESS would not act as nervous as he has.
COP: He couldn't even use a WEAPON during the ACTIVITY we just did!
COP: A dirty ANIMAL would act so nervous just like he is!
CAPO: Alright you two have given your alibi's however.
CAPO: Times up.
(gunshot)
COP: (clench stomach) W-why? (dies)
ROOKIE: W-w-was it him!?
CAPO: Yes, he was the dirty ANIMAL, What gave it away was that he knew about Fat Tony.
MOB BOSS: Anyone who wasn't a dirty ANIMAL would not of known about Fat Tony.
ROOKIE: I suppose, I didn't even know about Fat Tony.
MOB BOSS: Well, you made it kid, your a part of the mob now.
CAPO: Well boss, (Point to dead body) what should I do with this mess?
MOB BOSS: That guy? Take out the trash, if you know what I mean.
CAPO: Right away boss, I'll get the tools.

SHERIFF: You're under arrest for robbing the Grand Central Railroad of all its CARGO!

WHITEHAT: What are you talking about?! I ain't a criminal, I never done a train robbery!
WHITEHAT: And besides, would a criminal have bought their own boots, (point at your feet) and had 'em made in PINK?
SHERIFF: Are you gonna come quietly? Or am I gonna have to SHOOT you?

SHERIFF: This is the WRENCH the engineer found on the tracks! The WRENCH you used to uncouple the wagon with all the CARGO in it!
SHERIFF: And it's not got a single fingerprint on it! Because you wore GLOVEs!
WHITEHAT: (Laugh mockingly) Number one, every cowboy in this entire town wears GLOVEs.

WHITEHAT: I should've known you'd show up eventually, PINHEAD.
BLACKHAT: (Angrily, aiming at the good guy) That is not my name!

BLACKHAT: (Aim at the good guy) Dude!
WHITEHAT: If you put the gun down now and come quietly, everybody lives. If you SHOOT the old man, I'll SHOOT you.
WHITEHAT: But if you SHOOT me, you'll never learn where the CARGO is. Either way, you'll never get what you want.
BLACKHAT: CARGO? What CARGO?
WHITEHAT: I'm surprised you don't remember - it was your plan. You were asleep when we used that WRENCH on the Grand Central Railroad's wagon.
WHITEHAT: How embarrassing.
SHERIFF: W-Wait... So you did do the robbery?!
WHITEHAT: I sure did, old man.
SHERIFF: Then why are you helpin' me?

WHITEHAT: If you SHOOT me, you'll never know. But let's be gentlemen. I'll tell you here and now, then you got motivation to SHOOT me.
WHITEHAT: The old man's gone. We'll have ourselves a good old-fashioned quick draw. Winner takes all.

SHERIFF: (Enter stage right) PINHEAD, you're under arrest for conspirin' to commit grand theft and attempted murder. You have the right to remain SILENT.

noir music 1
THEA: What a lovely night – a friendly gala with my family and friends. Right, MEMBER Shannon?

THEA: That definitely got us in a funk – and what about that time when you ran with scissors, Ralphie?
RALPH: I was hyper, OK?
AMY: (scream loudly)
Music Stops
record scratch
SHANNON: What was that?
THEA: Was that Amy?
AMY: (enter from Stage Right Door, quivering in fear) ... Everyone? I have some terrible news!
RALPH: What’s wrong, Auntie Amy?
SHANNON: Did Cameron ACTION your BODYPART again?
AMY: No…he’s dead! MURDERED!
thunder
RALPH: Huh?!
Meanwhile THEA: WHAT?!
mystery music 1
AMY: He was lying lifeless on the bed…blood everywhere…(start breaking down into tears)
SHANNON: I’ll call the police.
THEA: No, MEMBER Shannon! Let’s get a detective here first! I know just who. (leave through Stage Right Door)
AMY: (sobbing) His throat…a gaping slit in his throat…
RALPH: How do you know he was murdered?
Meanwhile THEA: Hello, operator? Have Detective Davison come to our LOCATION.
SHANNON: Not the time to ask that question, Ralph.
THEA: (reenter from Stage Right Door) Just don’t panic everyone, the Detective should be here any moment--
tire screech
knocking on door
Teleport DETECTIVE DAVISON to Entrance Stage Left
THEA: That must be him. (go to Stage Left Door, then open it)
DETECTIVE DAVISON: Good evening, all. I heard that I was summoned here.
SHANNON: We are grateful for your presence, Mr. Detective.
DETECTIVE DAVISON: You can call me Dr. Davison, but only if you wish.
Meanwhile RALPH: (wander offstage toward Stage Right Door)
SHANNON: (follow Ralph offstage, in confusion) Ralph, where are you going?
AMY: Ugh…I think I’m going to be sick from that sight…worse than when I drank that whole CONTAINER of DRINK! (Leave through Stage Right Door)
dark classical music

RALPH: (Enter from Stage Right Door, licking his fingers) Hey, what’s going on in here---
gunshot
RALPH: (fall to ground)
Meanwhile THEA: (shriek) My son! Was it my son?!
DETECTIVE DAVISON: Might have been – there’s blood on his hands.
THEA: What?! Does that mean he’s the killer?
Meanwhile DETECTIVE DAVISON: (approach the body of Ralph)
DETECTIVE DAVISON: It would appear so; he was holding a stained knife in his hand as well!
THEA: (sigh of relief) Thank goodness.
footsteps on wood
BILLY: (enter from Stage Right Door) Aunt Thea! I saw something- (gasp) RALPHIE!
DETECTIVE DAVISON: Who are you?
Meanwhile THEA: Don’t get close to him, Billy! He’ll think you’re involved with Ralph’s antics!
BILLY: What antics? What did Ralph do? Did he cheat at GAME again?
DETECTIVE DAVISON: This suspect murdered Cameron, wife of Amy.
BILLY: What?! Ralphie would never do such a thing! Before I went upstairs, he said he was going to get something to eat!
DETECTIVE DAVISON: Are you absolutely sure- wait a minute… (crouch to Ralph’s body, wipe finger on knife, then taste it)
Music Stops
DETECTIVE DAVISON: This isn’t blood – it’s FOOD jelly!

AMY: (approach Davison and Thea menacingly, holding knife) So, that rotten brat told you, huh?
tense cinematic music
THEA: Amy…why? Why would you do such a vile thing? To your husband! To MEMBER Shannon! And to your own son! Why?!
AMY: (snarly tone) Cameron never appreciated me…he always wanted to do what was best for Billy…
thunder
AMY: Shannon never liked me either! And Billy always got the best in life while I was thrown to the wolves!
DETECTIVE DAVISON: So, you resorted to killing them!
AMY: Same went for the man who broke the Clue DVD he borrowed from me and the student driver who ran over my APPENDAGE last month!
DETECTIVE DAVISON: You killed them, too…I should have known it was you all along!
THEA: Amy, please… calm down...
Meanwhile DETECTIVE DAVISON: (reach behind back for shotgun)

RALPH: (gets up) Uh…what happened?
THEA: Ralph! You’re alive! (hugs him strongly, kisses him a lot)
DETECTIVE DAVISON: But- but, how? I thought you were shot dead!
RALPH: (reach inside shirt, pull out frozen dinner) This frozen DINNER I tried to smuggle in my shirt saved me!
THEA: Well, I think we can all say…
DETECTIVE DAVISON: Case. Closed.

Superhero fanfare
PRES: Good evening fellow Americans. We are gathered here today to decide the fate of this new local hero.
Crowd woo
PRES: Just recently this person saved children and staff of a nearby elementary school from a DANGER attack.
PRES: And while they saved many lives... the school, which had existed since 1956, was destroyed entirely by a fire caused by POWER.
PRES: leaving some people to believe this vigilante should be punished for their crimes.
PRES: Joining us in the debate is NAME. Leader of Team TEAM. And on the opposing bench, you all might recognize as our charmingly snarky Vice President.
applause
VICE: I'm sorry but this is a waste of time. We should all go home now. This person in front of us shouldn't get to join Team TEAM.
VICE: I went to that school they burned down, and they were the best years of my life!
LEAD: As the leader of Team TEAM I believe this new hero has everything we are looking for in a member.
LEAD: I've seen them TALENT and they may even be better at it than me.
VICE: TALENT is not a talent. I could do that in my sleep. What does this person really offer? Look at them. They're scrawny and clearly unfit.
HERO: I have to disagree Vice President. I am as fit as a ANIMAL.
HERO: My strict fitness regimen of weight lifting and only eating FOOD has made me the strong hero who saved all those elementary kids.
PRES: FOOD huh? From this day forward I will make sure that FOOD is served in all the school lunches of America for the rest of time.
HERO: And might I add, if I get to join Team TEAM I would like to be known as Super Hero NICKNM.
LEAD: Super Hero NICKNM? That is the greatest name I've ever heard.
VICE: That was the name of our schools pet hamster who perished in the fire. You didn't save him did you Super Hero NICKNM!
HERO: I'm sorry that my POWER burned down the school.
HERO: I'm taking this name in honor of your school's pet hamster, and as a reminder of my biggest mistake. So I can be more careful in the future.
LEAD: See? Modest and caring. Super Hero NICKNM you are a national treasure.
VICE: National treasure? I'll bet they don't even know anything about this great Nation. Quick, name three American States!
HERO: um...New York, Texas and PLACE.
VICE: Haha! PLACE isn't a state. They're obviously not an American Citizen at all, and therefore can't join Team TEAM.
VICE: They deserved to be locked up for their crimes of burning down buildings!
HERO: I was just joking. It was a joke.
LEAD: (hysterical laughter) And they're funny too! If that isn't enough to convince you people, then I'm gonna have to bring in the big guns.
LEAD: I'd like to bring in a witness who was saved by Super Hero NICKNM on the night of the DANGER attack. She's a big fan of their's and an even bigger fan of mine.
PRES: I will allow it. Please come in special guest.
FAN: (Enter Left Stage)Hello everyone! I am Vanessa and I am NAME's biggest fan!
LEAD: (flirty) Hey Snookie Bear. Miss me?
VICE: Vanessa? This is my daughter! She's a teacher at the school. You're telling me "you" saved her?
FAN: That's right, and I can't hide it anymore. Super Hero NICKNM saved me from the DANGER attack.
FAN: And although I have been NAME's biggest fan for NUMBER years, I believe I have found a new love.
LEAD: Wait what?
FAN: I am madly in love with Super Hero NICKNM, and everything I ever thought about NAME is over.
LEAD: But Snookie Bear, remember...? You're my fiancée... I just proposed to you this morning. You said yes!
FAN: That was so NUMBER minutes ago. I'm dropping you for the heart throb who saved my life.
aww
FAN: And it's an honor to be here to watch as they become the new member of Team TEAM.
HERO: Love ya babe!
LEAD: Well hold on now, it's not set in stone yet.
LEAD: We're still deciding, and actually I'm starting to think this might be a bad idea. I mean they're not that good at TALENT.
laughter
LEAD: I've never eaten FOOD... so that's probably why my muscles are so much bigger than their's.
HERO: They're not that much bigger.
LEAD: Also, everyone knows PLACE isn't a real state. Who would I be if I let someone that dumb on the team?
VICE: You saved my daughter? You really are a hero! You are an upstanding American! A patriarch of our Country and you definitely deserve to join Team TEAM.
LEAD: Not you too!
HERO: Thank you Vice President. I will make America proud with my signature move. (Makes a gesture). I call it SIGNATURE .
PRES: I love it! We should just fire that old NAME and make you the new leader of the team! To quote my grandfather "Where the bald eagle soars, you fly higher!"

RUMSAY: It's time for another episode of Milkshake Factory, a show where I taste and rate epic, frothy combinations.
RUMSAY: That didn't sound right. I'm suing the teleprompter after this show.
RUMSAY: And today, I'm joined by my apprentice, APPRENTICE NAME, who makes an awful lot of terrible milkshakes and a lot of bad decisions in life in general.
APPRENTICE: They're not all bad. The one with INGREDIENT was actually pretty good.
RUMSAY: That milkshake somehow caught on fire.
APPRENTICE: You like it spicy. That's what you told me last night.
RUMSAY: (agitated) We'll discuss that later.
RUMSAY: Today, we're going to try a milkshake that I personally made. (takes shake from kitchen counter) This is the FLAVOR shake. Simple. Elegant.
APPRENTICE: Smells like catfish, but it's absolutely scrumptious if you don't know what's in it.
APPRENTICE: I've already prepared my will in the event I cease to be after drinking this. There is so much FLAVOR!
RUMSAY: Your tastebuds may file for divorce, your toilet will go on strike, and you may lose a BODY PART.
APPRENTICE: But rest assured, this will be the best milkshake you've ever had.
RUMSAY: Let's drink. Drink it up. (drinks milkshake)
APPRENTICE: Cheers to inevitable oblivion! (drinks milkshake)
Tense Cinematic Music
RUMSAY: And the verdict? APPRENTICE?
APPRENTICE: It's definitely not, not terrible. Lots of milk. Creamy, even.
RUMSAY: Yes. Lots of FLAVOR. Looks like you got some on your BODY PART there.
APPRENTICE: Better find a napkin to clean it off of me. Slowly (poses).
Waterphone
RUMSAY: No! That is inappropriate! This show is for GROUP! What is wrong with you? It's in the contract you wouldn't say those things.
APPRENTICE: Forget the GROUP. It also says in my contract that I wasn't allowed to put a OBJECT in the milkshake.
RUMSAY: Which you've done NUMBER times already. And even though I drank your milkshake NUMBER times and developed CONDITION, I always resented that I drank it.
APPRENTICE: You didn't tell me. And why did you drink it? Why must you punish yourself?
RUMSAY: Because milkshakes... Listen to me, APPRENTICE. Look at me in the eyes. Not on my BODY PART. Eyes up here. Look at me.
RUMSAY: Because milkshakes... bring all the GROUP to the yard. If you make a milkshake, I will be brought to the yard.
APPRENTICE: This is a kitchen.
RUMSAY: But metaphorically speaking, it is a yard. You're much too young to understand metaphors. They go over your head.
APPRENTICE: (looks up) I don't see anything.
RUMSAY: But my milkshake is better than yours. That's why I host this show. That's why GROUP love me.
RUMSAY: And they enjoy the milkshakes I make. But I couldn't make milkshakes without you, dear APPRENTICE.
RUMSAY: For so long, I couldn't make proper milkshakes. I spend long hours, days even, making milkshakes by myself in this kitchen.
APPRENTICE: And sometimes, those milkshakes were made prematurely.
RUMSAY: Other times I had to take CONDITION pills to make my milkshakes last longer than a hour. But then you came into my life.
APPRENTICE: I did a number of times.

INVESTIGATOR: (enters room) Alright NAME, so why'd you do it?
TEENAGER: Do what?
INVESTIGATOR: Don't play dumb with me! I know you were behind the INTERNET crime.
OFFICER: The INTERNET crime?
INVESTIGATOR: Yes, the INTERNET crime! A crime so heinous, that it was enough to destroy the MONUMENT!
TEENAGER: You have no proof that I did that crime. I'd never do such an act.
INVESTIGATOR: Oh really? That's not what your FAMILY told me.
TEENAGER: My FAMILY? What did they tell you?
INVESTIGATOR: They told me that you've been acting very strange the past several months. Moreso since your friends all moved away.
INVESTIGATOR: Your FAMILY also told me you've been spending a lot of time online, looking up some very interesting topics.
TEENAGER: You're bluffing.
INVESTIGATOR: Oh, am I? Does the term, TOPIC, ring a bell?
OFFICER: TOPIC?
TEENAGER: Don't you dare.

INVESTIGATOR: Are you ready to spill the beans now?
TEENAGER: Alright, I admit it. I was the one who caused the INTERNET crime.
INVESTIGATOR: Exactly. But what I want to know is, why? Why did you do it?
TEENAGER: After all my friends left me, I felt...EMOTION. I didn't know what to do.

INVESTIGATOR: Alright NAME, how about you explain?
TEENAGER: Fine.
TEENAGER: TOPIC has been growing in popularity recently, so I figured that would be a good way to try and reconnect with my friends.
TEENAGER: After spending countless days and nights studying TOPIC, I figured out a plan, involving acts from said game. It was foolproof.
INVESTIGATOR: Did you ever stop to think about the actions of your plan?
TEENAGER: I didn't think it'd go that far. Never far enough to destroy the MONUMENT.

jazz music 1
DOCTOR: Good heavens Paddy, you're in a right old state! Tell me exactly what happened.
PADDY: Well now, that's a long story. I was knocked out at one point, but Mick was working with me so he can fill in the gaps.
MICK: It was his own bloody fault, I told him to just carry all the BRICKS down one at a time.
DOCTOR: BRICKS?
PADDY: Aye, we were working on that new HOTEL in DUBLIN, the one that was gonna open next month.
MICK: Me and Paddy had carried about HUNDRED kilos of BRICKS up to the top to do the work.
PADDY: And when we were done, I thought it'd be a good idea to lower the BRICKS down in a small barrel using a pulley.
PADDY: Eighty feet is a long way to carry stuff up and down by hand, and I'd already carried it up there once.
MICK: I told him it was a bad idea and I didn't want to get in trouble, so I just came down the ladder.
PADDY: I went down too, and tied off the rope on a BIKERACK, then I went back up and loaded the barrel with the BRICKS.
DOCTOR: And then what happened?
PADDY: Well, I came back down the ladder, held the rope tightly to support the weight, and untied the rope from the BIKERACK.
MICK: I tried to warn him, but he just didn't listen!
DOCTOR: Why, what happened then?
PADDY: Well to be sure, I was surprised! I was so surprised that I forgot to let go!
MICK: Paddy only weighed about half the weight of the barrel! He shot up in the air like a rocket!
PADDY: Next thing I knew, I was about forty feet in the air, and I met the barrel coming down as I was going up!
PADDY: I think I must have hit my HEAD on the barrel and broke it.
DOCTOR: The X-rays seem to agree with you there, Paddy.
MICK: But he kept on going up, up, up, until he got his HAND jammed in the pulley.
DOCTOR: Did you not think to let go by this point, Paddy?
PADDY: Doc, I got hit in the HEAD by a HUNDRED-kilo barrel of BRICKS! I wasn't thinking straight!
MICK: You weren't thinking straight when you untied the rope, you eejit!
MICK: Anyway, by this time the barrel had smashed into the BIKERACK and the bottom came off.
DOCTOR: I think I know where this is going. About HUNDRED kilos of BRICKS spilled out on the pavement?
MICK: Aye! And then what do you think happened?
DOCTOR: The barrel now weighed less than Paddy? So he fell back down and the barrel went back up?
MICK: You hit the nail on the HEAD, Doc!
PADDY: I just about regained my senses when I started falling again, still clinging on to the rope.
PADDY: I must've fallen about forty feet when I met the barrel again on the way up.
PADDY: I think I must have hit my LEGs on the barrel and broke them.
DOCTOR: You're right there Paddy, when the nurses examined your LEGs they found you had in fact broken both of them.
DOCTOR: And I have to say, we were impressed.
PADDY: Thank you Doc. But I kept falling, and the only thing that broke my fall was that big pile of BRICKS.
MICK: Yep, he fell right onto the pile, he landed right on his BACK, and he must have broke it in three places!
PADDY: By this time, I really was in a lot of pain, so much pain that I let go of the rope.
DOCTOR: You did what?!
MICK: He let go of the rope, Doc.
DOCTOR: But the barrel must have been eighty feet in the air again!
PADDY: Not for long, Doc. As I lay there on top of the HUNDRED-kilo pile of BRICKS, I saw the barrel hurtle back down towards me.
PADDY: But just before it hit me, I blacked out with all the pain.
MICK: That was probably for the best, it landed right on your RIBCAGE, and the rope followed it like a big string of spaghetti.
MICK: You were a mess.
DOCTOR: And then what happened?
MICK: I called for a paramedic, I said "He's lying on top of a big pile of BRICKS next to a broken BIKERACK," and they brought him here to you.
DOCTOR: Right. So you've got a broken HEAD, a mangled HAND, two magnificent broken LEGs, one broken BACK and one shattered RIBCAGE.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it doesn't look good for you, Paddy. What do you want me to do about it?

Happy Music 1
PETER: Enjoying the FOOD? I made 'em nice and juicy just for you.
ANDY: Yeah, man. Say Peter, an I ask you for some advice?
PETER: Sure, man. What's up?
ANDY: So, let’s say you’re, hypothetically, in a bit of trouble. Like, "Holy EXCLAMATION!" kind of trouble.
PETER: Hypothetically, huh? Okay, shoot.
ANDY: Right. So, let's say you need to VERB a lot of "stuff" from one PLACE to another.
PETER: (curious) Stuff? What kind of stuff are we talking about?
ANDY: You know, just packages. For a friend. CELEBRITY.
PETER: CELEBRITY? Really? Okay. And what kind of packages are we talking here, Andy?
ANDY: The kind of packages that make you really, really nervous if you get caught with them.
ANDY: The kind that make you sweat around your BODYPART.
PETER: Specifically your BODYPART?
ANDY: Like around that area, not necessarily on it.
PETER: Hold on. Are you talking about drugs?
ANDY: Drugs? Who said drugs? I didn't say drugs. Let's just call it "expensive INGREDIENT."
PETER: Uh-huh. And who’s looking for this "expensive INGREDIENT"? An angry chef?
ANDY: A very persuasive group of individuals. The kind who might come at you with a OBJECT if you disappoint them.
PETER: And they would use this OBJECT on you.
ANDY: Repeatedly, I'm sure.
PETER: Are these "individuals" covered in tattoos, possibly named things like "El ADJECTIVE Diablo"?
ANDY: Swing and miss. Definitely not. Maybe, though. This is all just a big "what if," right.
ANDY: We're just shooting the stuff. Guy talk. Things two dudes normally talk about in a backyard.
PETER: Andy, are you telling me you stole drugs from a cartel?
ANDY: What? No! I’m just asking for a friend. Let's call them CELEBRITY. And they'll need protection, obviously.
PETER: You mean like a WEAPON?
ANDY: Yes, obviously a WEAPON. CELEBRITY would need that to protect themselves.
PETER: (leaning in, intense) Okay, let's sum this up. You are in possession of a large quantity of stolen drugs.
PETER: The cartel is after you, and you're looking for advice on how to protect yourself?
ANDY: What should they do, Peter?
PETER: No. Stop with the hypothetical. I get it. You need help. Damn it, man!
PETER: (calmly) First, you need to get out of PLACE immediately. Then change his name to something ridiculous.
ANDY: Like CELEBRITY?
PETER: That name is clearly taken. Shut up for a second. You need to find a good hiding spot, like a OBJECT at the bottom of a lake.
PETER: Also, you might want to learn how to ACTIVITY because it could come in handy.
ANDY: Random, but fine. That makes sense. But what if he wanted to turn things around.
PETER: I know it's you, dude.
ANDY: He should make a romantic gesture instead.
PETER: A romantic gesture? To whom? The freakin' cartel?
ANDY: Well, what if this "friend" of mine just wanted to impress someone special?
PETER: By stealing drugs from a cartel and going on the run?
ANDY: (laughs awkwardly) No, no. What? No! I'm just seeking regular romance advice.
PETER: You're telling me that this other person over here is not in possession of stolen drugs.
PETER: And for this entire time, this entire hypothetical is about romantic advice?
PETER: (exasperated) Andy, I think your "friend" needs to get his priorities straight.
ANDY: (smiling) Thanks, Peter. That’s exactly what I needed to hear. I feel so much better now.
Gunshot
ANDY: (grinning) Hey, Peter. I need some more advice.
PETER: What now? What could your "friend," CELEBRITY hypothetically need at this very moment?
ANDY: He might be wondering why he was shot.

JOE: Well, Jack, they say age is just a number. And in my case, that number is RNUMBER.

JOE: Can I get one of those R2NOUNs in my house? Might help make the floors less slippery around here.
ZARNOK: Now, let's move on to something more serious. What are your plans for the future of healthcare?
JOE: We need healthcare that works for everyone. Free Band-Aids, discounted COUGH syrup from the local horse cart.
JOE: I promise to personally hand out DRUG to anyone who needs it. Check under your seats, folks. There is a giant pill.
Tada
DON: My plan is simple. The best doctors, the best medicine, and of course, the best prices.
DON: We’re talking about beautiful healthcare, folks. Beautiful. It's so beautiful, you would want to get sick.
ZARNOK: Alright. How will you handle the intergalactic threat. I mean, international relations?
JOE: Interga-what-now? Look, we need to be friends with everyone. I’m talking HUGs, people.
JOE: Big ol' HUGS for every world leader. Even the ones who don’t shower. Maybe especially those.
DON: I'll handle it the way I handle everything. With style, with class, and with tweets. They call them posts now.
DON: Lots and lots of posts. Upper caps. Everyone loves big letters. Not the tiny ones. They're like tiny BODYPARTs.
ZARNOK: I hear no woman likes tiny BODYPARTs.
DON: But some do.
ZARNOK: My last question. What is your message to the people of the United States of Earth?
JOE: Well, Jack. Look, we've come so far. And we need to come some more. Re-elect me and I'll buy you a FROZEN.
DON: Everything is terrible. Our great country has fallen faster than my opponent on stairs. Vote for me or I'll say it's rigged.
ZARNOK: Well, I think I’ve heard enough. After much consideration, I have concluded that Earth can neither be saved nor conquered.
ZARNOK: So, I’m going back to my home planet. Good luck, Earthlings. You’ll need it.

ROBERT: Thank you for inviting us over to your place, Daryl.
DARYL: Don't mention it. I know you guys really wanted to visit, so I thought, "Why not?" It's a beautiful day today.
DARYL: Speaking of which, why did you want to visit my backyard so badly?
HANK: (whispering) Hey, shut up for a second. Look at the bark on that one, man. It's got such a unique texture!
ROBERT: Oh yeah, that's a Quercus robur. The English TREENAME. You don't see those around here too often.
HANK: Look at those branches strutting their stuff! It's like it's dancing to some MUSICGENRE. You go girl!
DARYL: Y'all really out here tree watching? Seriously? What do you even see in these trees?
ROBERT: Daryl, it's like bird-watching, but better. Trees are so majestic, so grounded. They have stories, history!
ROBERT: This one here, for instance, could be over BIGNUMBER years old. Imagine the things it's seen!
DARYL: (sarcastic) Yeah, like kids playing catch and dogs peeing on it. Fascinating.
HANK: Don't kink-shame the trees, man. They've been on journeys.
DARYL: Journeys? Dude, trees don't move. They don't go anywhere.
ROBERT: No, really! You just have to look deeper. Every leaf, every branch tells a story.
HANK: Oh my gosh, look! The leaves are rustling in a peculiar way. It's almost like they're trying to communicate.
DARYL: Yeah, sure. Maybe it's saying, "Get these ADJPERSON people outta here."
ROBERT: Oh, we're not ADJPERSON. Bruh, we know where the action is at. That TREENAME has cake!

OAKUS: (enters stage right) Hello, humans. I am Oakus, the ancient tree spirit.
HANK: See, Daryl? I told you! The trees can talk!
ROBERT: Oakus, we are honored by your presence. What wisdom do you have for us?
OAKUS: I have stood here for centuries, watching the world change. And now, I must tell you something.
Silly music 2
OAKUS: You are all really, really high right now. Y'all smoke enough trees to see talking trees. Impressive!
DARYL: (laughing) Wait, what? Are you telling me this whole time we've just been hallucinating?
OAKUS: Indeed. Those FOOD you ate earlier were not just regular FOOD. I mean, it's possible they were simply really good FOOD.
OAKUS: But then you chewed on my tree bark for reasons I cannot understand. I liked it, though.
ROBERT: Oh man, this is too good. Tree watching while high. Classic.
HANK: No wonder the leaves were so captivating.
DARYL: I knew something was off. Trees don’t just start talking out of nowhere.
ROBERT: O wise Oakus! What other pearls of wisdom do you have to bestow on us lowly creatures?
OAKUS: Be mindful of the world around you or else you may become a viral Internet meme.
DARYL: Yeah, like a bunch of dudes talking to trees. Totally poggers. Won't be mid.
OAKUS: You are a grown CREATURE. Don't talk like that. Or maybe you aren't. I don't know. I might be high too, actually.
OAKUS: Oh! Appreciate the simple things. And always, always read the labels on your SNACKs.
HANK: There is so much to learn! So little time to actually follow through.
ROBERT: If the SNACKs are delicious, there is no reason to read the warning signs. Anything else, Lord Oakus?
OAKUS: Enjoy your trip, humans. But remember, the real magic of nature is in the sobriety of its beauty.
OAKUS: Oh, and by the way, your best friend has been a tree this entire time. You refer to him as Daryl.
ROBERT: Oh. Seriously? Well, that was one unforgettable tree-watching session.
HANK: Yeah, next time, maybe we should just stick to regular FOOD.
ROBERT: Or, you know, maybe try bird-watching. I hear they talk less.
HANK: That is really funny. What do you think Daryl. Daryl?

CONTESTANT2: Yea, I did actually, do you want it? I'll sell it to you for 8 million dollars.
HOST: 8 MILL- (Walk back to host stand) Okay, let's move on to our next scenario.
HOST: This time, you're late for an important job interview. What's your excuse, CONTESTANTNAME1?

CONTESTANT1: Well, in my case, I was stuck in traffic, right? And then suddenly
CONTESTANT1: a ANIMAL parade broke out in front of me! So naturally, I had to join in and dance my way through it.
Gameshow Ding

ACTOR2: (Acting as contestant 1 in a parade) I love ANIMAL parades!
HOST: (Laughs) That's quite the sight, CONTESTANTNAME1! You really know how to turn a traffic jam into a party.
HOST: Now, CONTESTANTNAME2, what is your excuse for being late to an important job interview?
Gameshow Ring
CONTESTANT2: Well, you see HOSTNAME, I woke up this morning feeling like a million dollars.
CONTESTANT2: However, as soon as I stepped outside, I realized my car had transformed into a giant OBJECT!
CONTESTANT2: And not just any OBJECT, mind you—it had a mind of its own, and wings!
Gameshow Ding
ACTOR1: (Acting as a passerby) Is that a flying OBJECT car!?
ACTOR2: (Acting as CONTESTANTNAME2) Indeed it is! I tried to reason with it, but it was dead set on taking me for a joyride around town.
HOST: (Laughs) A flying OBJECT car with a mind of its own—now that's a new one, CONTESTANTNAME2!
HOST: That must have been quite the adventure. CONTESTANTNAME2, did you manage to explain this wild ride to your potential employers?
CONTESTANT2: Unfortunately, by the time the flying car decided to return me to solid ground, the interview had already concluded.
CONTESTANT2: They were quite understanding, though—everyone loves a good flying car story, right?

SCRIPT ==========================================
STORY: Hello, boys and girls, and welcome to the show. My name is Resotski Tarkov, and I am going to tell you a story.
STORY: It is a nice story about triumph and hardship, about trials and errors. But anyway, let us begin.
sad chug jug music
STORY: Our story begins with a pilot named STEVEN. STEVEN was flying around northern Germany when something disastrous happened.
STORY: STEVEN forgot to check the ENGINE. With a yank and an awful crank, his plane started malfunctioning.
crashing debris
explosion
STORY: STEVEN's plane went tumbling down, crashing onto a mountain.
STORY: STEVEN would have been a dead man if there had not been a building on top of the mountain.
STORY: So, with all his might, STEVEN climbed to the building, which turned out to be a monastery.
PILOT: (limping on stage right) D-dammit, my leg is torn apart, and my plane is completely busted.
PILOT: (sighs) Well, it's a good thing this monastery is here. (shouting around) Hello... anyone here?
STORY: From a room at the back of the monastery, a monk came out to welcome STEVEN.
peaceful fantasy music
MONK: (enters stage left in a welcoming manner) Welcome, young one. What is your name, and what brings you here?
PILOT: My name is STEVEN, and I'm a pilot. My plane's ENGINE malfunctioned, and I crash-landed near your monastery.
STORY: STEVEN and the monk talked for a while as the monk tended to STEVEN's wounds.
STORY: Unfortunately, it would take around NUMBER months for help to reach the monastery, so STEVEN had plenty of time to get to know the monk.
MONK: Alright, your leg should be okay for now. I need to grab some things from the back room. Whatever you do, do not enter that room unless you are a monk.
STORY: STEVEN was puzzled by this statement, so he asked,
PILOT: (confused) Why can't I enter that back room? Is there something I shouldn't see? Something dangerous?
MONK: It is something only monks are allowed to see and know. (exits stage left)
STORY: This confused STEVEN even more, but STEVEN obeyed. Curiosity, however, got the better of him. While he was stuck at the monastery, he made a decision.
PILOT: (waiting for the monk to return) Hey, monk, can I become a monk like you?
meanwhile MONK: (re-enters stage left)
MONK: Hmm, that is possible, but it is a very painful and challenging process, young STEVEN.
PILOT: Bah, it’s nothing I can't handle. Besides, I’ve DIED before. There's nothing I can't handle.
STORY: STEVEN had never actually DIED before. He was too cowardly for that, but anyway...
MONK: Interesting, very interesting. You definitely have what it takes to become a monk.
MONK: To become a monk, you must complete three challenges that can span days, months, even years.
PILOT: Ah, don't worry. Once again, I’ve DIED before, so there's nothing I can't handle.
MONK: Alright, for your first test...
MONK: You must TEST1.
PILOT: Hah, that’s it? I'll get that done this evening, just you watch.
STORY: And so STEVEN went off to complete the first test, TEST1.
meanwhile PILOT: (moves to the front right of the stage and starts TEST1)
STORY: It took STEVEN 17 hours to complete the first test.
PILOT: Alright, monk, the first test is complete. (approaches the monk) Give me the next one.
MONK: Okay, little young STEVEN. Your next test...
MONK: You must TEST2.
PILOT: Another easy test. Here, monk, I'll get that done in one hour, just you watch. (moves to stage right)
STORY: It took poor STEVEN longer than just an hour; it took him NUMBER months to get it done.
meanwhile PILOT: (completing [TEST2])
STORY: But STEVEN eventually completed the task and went back to the monk.
PILOT: (out of breath) Alright, monk, second test complete. (approaches the monk) Time for the third one.
MONK: Indeed it is. It's time for the third and final test. Only then will you become a monk.
MONK: You must TEST3.
PILOT: Okay, that might be a little hard.
STORY: It wasn’t just a little hard; it was a monumental task. But STEVEN was determined to get it done.
STORY: For several months, STEVEN worked tirelessly to complete this third test.
meanwhile PILOT: (moves to the front right of the stage and starts TEST3)
STORY: STEVEN barely completed the test after two years, but finally, he had succeeded.
PILOT: (exhausted) F-finally, I’ve finished the tests. Monk, am I good to become a monk now?
MONK: That you are, poor little young STEVEN. But first, we must ACTION, then you will become a monk.
STORY: And so STEVEN did, and after all this time, he became a monk.
meanwhile PILOT: (performs ACTION)
PILOT: So, am I a monk now? Am I allowed to see what’s inside that door?
MONK: That you are, my adorable, poor little STEVEN. Come with me, and I shall show you what’s beyond this door. (exits stage left)
meanwhile PILOT: (follows the monk)
STORY: Now, kids, (walks to the middle of the stage) would you all like to know what’s behind that door?
STORY: It is something very special and very important.
STORY: The thing behind the door is...
gong
STORY: Oh, it seems like that’s all the time we have left. See you next time, kids!

SARAH: I’ll have the scrambled eggs with ANOTHERFOOD, please.
MIKE: Babe, I thought you were going with toast. Why ANOTHERFOOD?
SARAH: It's complicated, just like our relationship, and the baby that may or may not be inside me.

EGG: (enters stage left) Hey! What's up?

EGG: No, it’s me! The egg! You two monsters tried to order me.
MIKE: Wait. Seriously? You're an egg that can talk?
EGG: Finally, you noticed! Do you have any idea what it’s like being an egg in this world? Boiled, scrambled, fried.
EGG: Some you try to even to RANDOMVERB me! No respect.
SARAH: That sounds delicious though.
EGG: No respect! First thing I remember is I'm laid by a giant ANIMAL. I come out of this claustrophobic shell.
EGG: Then people want to eat me. It's insane! What have I done to any of you to deserve such a cruel fate?
SARAH: (bewildered) Am I dreaming? Am I high? Or is this egg talking?
EGG: Get it together, lady! This is all very real. I'm disappointed in you slowly realizing the gravity of this situation.
SARAH: Oh. Now I get it!
EGG: I’m here to make a stand. Why should we eggs be your breakfast victims every day? It’s exhausting!
MIKE: (nervously) Uh, what do you suggest we do, Mr. Egg?
EGG: How about a nice bowl of cereal with some ANOTHERFOOD on top? Leave us eggs alone for once!
MIKE: (stunned) This is insane. We can't just stop eating eggs!
EGG: Why not? You must be cracked. How about I toss you in a frying pan every morning?
SARAH: Maybe it’s time we rethink our breakfast choices. This egg makes a point.
MIKE: (reluctantly) Okay, okay. No eggs. Waiter!
WAITER: (enters stage right) Yes?
MIKE: Change of plans. No eggs. The egg over here told me to have no eggs.
EGG: Eggxactly. This is a tremendous breakthrough!
SARAH: What do you recommend that's different? We've never not had eggs before. This is uncharted territory.
WAITER: How about our baby CREATURE? Very popular.
SARAH: I think we'll both have that.
EGG: You’d switch to a baby CREATURE just like that? What is wrong with you people?
MIKE: Other than us suffering massive BODYPART wounds when we were kids, we're perfectly fine.
SARAH: Maybe we should just have pancakes and toast.
MIKE: (sighs) Yeah, pancakes and toast sound good.
WAITER: Perfect! I'll place the order, and hope I never see the two of you and the imaginary egg again.
EGG: (relieved) Now that’s more like it. Enjoy your breakfast. You too are not so bad after all.
EGG: Wait a minute! Pancakes use eggs. My fate is cooked!
MIKE: Mission accomplished, everyone. We made a talking egg happy!

Dark Classical Music
PAUL: Oh, Kelly, this is just the most ADJECTIVE music I've ever heard! It really makes me want to dance.
KELLY: I know, right? It's like our spirits are VERBING right out of our bodies! Cheers to depressing music!
Knocking on door
KELLY: I'll get it! (opens front door)
FRED: (enters from backstage) Hey guys, it's about NUMBER in the morning, and you're being way too loud.
PAUL: Is it only NUMBER in the morning? The night is still so young.
FRED: It's actually morning.
KELLY: We haven't touched our DRINK yet. Want some, Fred? It's warm and chunky, but refreshing.
FRED: Why would you even drink that? Are you insane? It's late. I have work in the morning.
FRED: So can you please, for the love of RANDOMNAME, can you turn down your music some?
PAUL: You're only upset because you don't appreciate good music. You're not culturally refined.
KELLY: Do you know who MUSICIAN is? They have so much depressing music.
PAUL: They really brings out the alcoholism in us.
FRED: This music is so depressing, and you’re blasting it like it’s a party anthem! Why?
KELLY: Oh, poor Fred. It’s not about the volume, it’s about the soul! This music touches our part of the body.
PAUL: Specifically the BODYPART. We just touch and touch. So much touching.
KELLY: Fred, you’re just too uptight. Have you tried VERBING a little?
FRED: Yes, I do. And maybe more than a little, but that's not the point.
FRED: I just don't understand why you would play the kind of music that plays in sad ANIMAL shelter commercials.
KELLY: It's about getting in touch with your feelings.
FRED: (angry) Stop using the word "touch." Very unsettling.
PAUL: (hiccup) You know what, Kelly? Maybe our imaginary neighbor is right. We should play something more uplifting.
KELLY: Couldn't agree with you more, honey! After you do that, let's have another DRINK.
FRED: Okay, first off: I'm not imaginary. Second, I didn't say anything about playing something more uplifting.
FRED: And come to think of it, I'm actually terrified of what you consider "uplifting." Just please keep it down.
KELLY: I can really go hard with this. It's making my BODYPART flutter! Who wrote this song?
PAUL: I think MUSICIAN did this. They've been producing an awful lot of bangers lately.
FRED: Awful is right. Starting to suspect both of you are playing me. What have I done to deserve this?
KELLY: Paul, I think Led Zeppelin did this. What was the other song they did that I like? Stairway to Heaving?
FRED: This is not them. And it's "Stairway to Heaven," not whatever cursed thing you just said.
FRED: Don't want to be a Karen, but if you don't turn down the music right now, I will have to call the cops.
PAUL: Geeze, Karen! You're no fun! Come on, honey. Let's go home. (exits front door)
KELLY: Unbelievable. I hope you one day find music that touches your BODYPART. (exits front door)

CLARK: (looks at Frank approaching him) Oh, great. Hi there, welcome to Sloppy Shoppy Mart. Did you find everything okay?
FRANK: Oh yes, everything was just delightful! Really good, actually.
CLARK: Wonderful. Let's get you checked out. Bread, milk, cereal, and some OBJECT.
FRANK: Oh, uh, wait a second. The OBJECT. I’m not sure about that.
CLARK: (exasperated, but trying to hide it) Not sure about the OBJECT?
FRANK: Yeah, you see, I’m buying it for my great-grandmother and great-grandfather. This is a huge decision.
CLARK: (sighing deeply) Okay, take your time. I’ll just stand here.
FRANK: (pulls out phone, dialing dramatically) I’m gonna call them.
FRANK: Great-grandma, great-grandpa, do you really want the OBJECT? No, no, not orange juice. OBJECT.
FRANK: Yes, the kind with all the things you two like. Okay, let me get my uncle. He knows more about this.
STEVEN: (enters entrance stage right) I hear we’re contemplating the OBJECT purchase?
CLARK: Yes, we are. Anything I can help with?

STEVEN: Frank, can you get our FAMILYMEMBER to come in?
CLARK: FAMILYMEMBER? What the actual Hell?
PETER: (enters entrance stage right) Heard you guys are deciding on OBJECT. Any warranties on this bad boy?
CLARK: Warranties? For that?! I can understand asking for a warranty on EXPENSIVE, but this? No.
CLARK: I know inflation is a problem right now, big and round, but this is getting ridiculous.
PETER: This is in case OBJECT goes bad or doesn’t meet the taste standards.
CLARK: It's just OBJECT! There is no legitimate need to deliberate this at all. None whatsoever.
PETER: What are your payment options?
CLARK: Finally! This is a normal question. We take cash, check or credit card at our store.
PETER: How about we barter for an ANIMAL? It's got an extra set of BODYPARTs and has paid all their student loan debt!
CLARK: Oh my bleeping God. I want to bleeping curse so badly, but I will be fired and banished to the SHADOW REALM if I do.

SCRIPT ==========================================
World news intro
MODERATOR: (Monotone) Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to tonight's debate on the age-old question: CANINES or FELINES? In one corner, we have the ever-charming, CELEBRITY.
DEBATER #1: Thank you, thank you. CANINES all the way, baby!
MODERATOR: (Monotone) And in the other corner, we have...uh...an unknown individual who signed up last minute. Let's call them, uh, NOBODY.
DEBATER #2: FELINES rule!
MODERATOR: (Yawns) Alright, let's make this quick. CELEBRITY, you have the floor.
Badass music 1
DEBATER #1: CANINES. They're loyal, always happy to see you, and they ACTION! What more could you want? They're basically fluffy bundles of joy and loyalty.
DEBATER #2: Mind you, FELINES are also fluffy bundles of joy and loyalty.
DEBATER #1: Even so, CANINES are always down for adventure-hiking, swimming, and ACTIVITY? They're like your own personal cheerleaders.
DEBATER #2: They're more akin to slobbery chaos machines that eat your shoes and wreck your home, then they are cheerleaders.
DEBATER #1: Factually untrue. What is true, is that you'll never be lonely with CANINES around, and that they're great listeners.
DEBATER #2: So are FELINES. And guess what? They SOUND. It's like having a tiny, furry OCCUPATION on call.
MODERATOR: (Checking watch) Fascinating. I'm enthralled, really.
DEBATER #2: Also, you can be gone for a weekend, and they'll be fine. And have you seen FELINES jump? It's like watching a ninja in action. They're independent.
DEBATER #1: Independent? More like indifferent. CANINES are always there for you, through thick and thin. They're your ride-or-die companions.
DEBATER #2: Unless there's a MAMMAL. Then you're on your own. Also, FELINES don't need walks at 6 AM in the freezing cold.
DEBATER #1: All part of the bonding experience. Plus, CANINES are great for your social life. Take one to the park, and you're suddenly the most popular person there.
DEBATER #2: Yeah, if you enjoy getting slobbered on by all the CANINES in a 5-mile radius.
MODERATOR: Ain't that the truth.
DEBATER #1: Aren't you supposed to be indifferent here?
MODERATOR: I'm not paid enough to care.
DEBATER #1: Anyways, FELINES act like they're doing you a favor by existing.
DEBATER #2: Not true!
Music Stops
Record scratch
VIEWER: (Barging in) Hold on a second. Stop everything!
MODERATOR: And what seems to be the problem?
VIEWER: I'm here to say this whole debate is pointless! Everyone knows that the true superior pet is...a ANIMAL.
Happy music 1
DEBATER #1: A ANIMAL?
Meanwhile DEBATER #2: A ANIMAL?
VIEWER: Exactly! No hair, no loud noises, and no dead animals. Just pure, sweet bliss and serenity. They won't beg for food, or wake you up at 5 AM.
DEBATER #1: Hold it, is this even allowed? They're not even a part of this debate!
MODERATOR: (Interested) No, let them cook. They might be onto something...
VIEWER: Thank you. And, if we need reminded, a ANIMAL won't destroy your house or SECRET when you aren't around.
MODERATOR: Folks, I think we might have a winner here.
VIEWER: Thank you for seeing the obvious answer. Now, can we all just go home?
DEBATER #1: Aren't we allowed a closing remark first?
MODERATOR: Nope! Debate adjourned!
