TRAINER: I'm sorry for your loss.
OWNER: Thank you. But it was worth it for the CUPCAKE.
WOMAN: (Stick head in through door) Your POODLE is in my bedroom!
WOMAN: Come get your out of control dog for crying out loud!
WOMAN: (Sneeze) Achoo! (Leave)
TRAINER: Meh, he'll be fine. My POODLE is very graceful.
OWNER: I can't look at another CUPCAKE without thinking of my husband Dave.
(70s music)
OWNER: (Looking at TRAINER flirtatiously) But you're not a CUPCAKE...
TRAINER: Are you saying you like to look at me?
OWNER: Do you work out?
TRAINER: I walk my dog while doing STRENUOUS ACTIVITY.
OWNER: (Rubbing the TRAINER's THIGHS) That must be killer on your THIGHS.

OWNER: (Petting the DOG, flirtatiously) Don't worry, it's got room for all three of us!
DOG: (Flirtatious woof) Woof woof~
Meanwhile OWNER: (Exit stage left)

Meanwhile OWNER: (Exit stage left)
DOG: Woof woof! (Pick up some MAGAZINES and follow the TRAINER, exit stage left)
(Music stops)
CAT: (Lonely meow) Mow
WOMAN: Aww, poor kitty. Your name was MITTENS, right? (Offering the cat a snack) Do you want some SNACK?
CAT: Mow (Pee on the floor)
Meanwhile WOMAN: (Reacting to CAT peeing on carpet) No! Not the clean floor! Bad kitty! Bad MITTENS! Shoo!
WOMAN: (Reacting to CAT peeing on carpet) No! Not the clean floor! Bad kitty! Bad MITTENS! Shoo!
Meanwhile CAT: (Hiss and run away, exit stage left) Hiss! Meow!

COWBOY: Ladies and gentle folk of the Jury, I mean America,
COWBOY: This country is in a no-good state.
COWBOY: It reminds me of that one time I wrangled a cow that done got its BODY PART blown off by a FRENCH WEAPON.
COWBOY: But listen here.
COWBOY: It is my humble belief that simpler is always better.
COWBOY: (Point at ALIEN) My opponent here would have you believe that their space-age alien technology is what you need.
COWBOY: But I beg you to reconsider.
COWBOY: (Point at ALIEN) But them there is the wrong kind of Alien.
COWBOY: One time, Aliens just like flew over my Uncle Bob's farm and stole his cows and does God knows what to them.
ALIEN: We VERB your cattle and eat their BODY PART. It makes us S T R O N G E R.
COWBOY: Now folks, I sure as shootin’ ain’t no space traveller
COWBOY: but I reckon I’m not feeling too confident about handing our nation's reins to a varmint like that (Point at ALIEN)...
COWBOY: whose idea of a good time is suckin' the BODY PART off of some poor, unsuspecting cow.
COWBOY: Also, you should vote for me because I like GUN.

ALIEN: Affirmative.
COWBOY: Is your entire species related or somethin like that?
ALIEN: Affirmative.
ALIEN: My species reproduces through inter-breeding with blood relatives and is therefore superior.

ALIEN: Our species will begin our invasion of Earth by dominating the United States of America....
ALIEN: The greatest country on Earth! (Hold up hands in celebration)
ALIEN: We will enslave all sentient life on this planet. But if you vote for me, you will be given one of the "good" slave jobs.

Applause
MODERATOR: Interesting points on both sides. However, we are almost out of time.
MODERATOR: Mr. Cletus Williams, do you have any closing remarks?
USA Anthem Music
COWBOY: Well folks, the choice is clear. A vote for me is a vote for good old-fashioned American values, like cows, and CAPITALISM.
COWBOY: I stand for guns, freedom, guns, CAPITALISM, and not getting our BODY PARTS eaten by extraterrestrial forces.
COWBOY: However, I do concede that the love between brother and sister is strong.
COWBOY: But the love between a man and his GUN is stronger.
COWBOY: Your honor, I rest my case.
Music stops
Applause
MODERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Williams. XN-74, your closing remarks?
USA Anthem Music
ALIEN: Our ultimate goal is not destruction, but construction.
ALIEN: From the plasma-scorched ashes of this miserable sphere of rock you call "Earth", we will rebuild a new society,
ALIEN: Built on the slave labor of humans, and fueled by INTERNAL ORGAN burgers...
ALIEN: which is what we call cow hamburgers made from the INTERNAL ORGAN of humans.
ALIEN: I mean cows! I meant to say the INTERNAL ORGAN of cows.
ALIEN: They are extremely delicious and will be given to all the "Good" humans who work hard and don't incite an uprising against ZORTRON.
ALIEN: The "bad" humans will be put to work in the burger factory.
ALIEN: (Point at audience) Puny Earthlings! Look under your chairs! Everyone gets a free MASSAGE DEVICE!
ALIEN: (Hold up hands in celebration) For the glory of ZORTRON!

DETECTIVE: (Looking out the window) It's late one November night.
DETECTIVE: (Walk up to audience) The cigarette smoke swirls around my apartment like the puzzles swim around my mind.
DETECTIVE: I'm knee-deep in a labyrinth of dead ends and unanswered questions.
DETECTIVE: Who exactly was the Big Apple Burglar?
DETECTIVE: Why do they steal priceless jewels and leave little notes behind?
DETECTIVE: I had a hunch that the burglar was actually a SNAKE wearing a burglar costume, but... that trail went cold.
DETECTIVE: Imagine that. A SNAKE wearing a cute little burglar costume.
DETECTIVE: (Smoke cigarette, gag, cough) Makes me sick to my stomach.
Knocking on door
DETECTIVE: (Calling out) Who's there?
PIZZA GUY: Pizza delivery.
DETECTIVE: Come on... the door's open.
PIZZA GUY: (Enter) Here's your personal pan pizza, sir. Extra TOPPING.
Noir music 2
DETECTIVE: (Step forward and speak to audience again) He walked into my office wearing a goofy Pizza delivery outfit.
DETECTIVE: And LEGS like CHOPSTICKS that went... ALL the way up.
DETECTIVE: They say crime is like a big, juicy pizza, overflowing with TOPPING.
DETECTIVE: Except instead of pizza, it's New York City.
DETECTIVE: And instead of TOPPING, it's crime.
DETECTIVE: And the cheese? That's the RATS.
DETECTIVE: But something was off about this personal pan pizza with extra TOPPING... I could feel it.
DETECTIVE: (Return to scene, talk to PIZZA GUY) How much do I owe you?
PIZZA GUY: That will be 15 dollars.
DETECTIVE: (Taking money out of wallet) Here, kid. Keep the change.
PIZZA GUY: Thanks, have a nice day (Begin to move toward the door)
PIZZA GUY: (Remembering something) Say, detective... you wouldn't happen to have any JEWELS laying around the office, would you?
DETECTIVE: JEWELS? Kid, don't get me started on JEWELS. (Bite into a slice of pizza)
DETECTIVE: (Talk with mouth full) I'm hot on the case of the Big Apply Burglar, and all that dastardly thief does is steal JEWELS.
DETECTIVE: Except the trail's gone cold... (Spit out the pizza) Just like this pizza.
DETECTIVE: Say, why'd it take so long for you to get here? This pizza is stone cold like MY MOTHER.
PIZZA GUY: Sorry, detective. I had to take a quick, uh, "detour" on the way over.
PIZZA GUY: ... at the gun store. (Take out a gun and point it at the detective)
Vine boom
Noir music 3
DETECTIVE: (Gasp) You. You're the Big Apple Burglar!
PIZZA GUY: Finally figured it out, eh, detective?
DETECTIVE: (Step forward and speak to audience again) It all made sense now.
DETECTIVE: The pizza boxes we found at the crime scene. The TOPPING on the victim's bodies.
DETECTIVE: It was right under my nose the entire time.
DETECTIVE: But I wasn't about to let this ADJECTIVE-NOSE little creep get away this time...
DETECTIVE: and besides... I had something the thief wanted that was more valuable than priceless JEWELS.
PIZZA GUY: (To DETECTIVE) You should have put assembled all the slices of this mystery sooner, detective.
PIZZA GUY: Now, I'm the one who's going to leave YOU a fat tip...
PIZZA GUY: The tip of my bullet in your chest.
DETECTIVE: Oh, but Pizza guy... or should I say, "Big Apple Burglar"... I have some information that will interest you very much.
PIZZA GUY: Oh yeah? Nice try. Stop stalling for time.
PIZZA GUY: I'm going to silence you like I silence the notifications on my phone when my wife tries to call me about IMPORTANT BUSINESS.
PIZZA GUY: Besides, the only thing I care about is stealing all of the JEWELS in this city...
DETECTIVE: ... so that you can buy your SNAKE back from the crime boss, Big KAHUNA Frankie?
Noir music 2
PIZZA GUY: (Lowering gun) H-how do you know about that?
PIZZA GUY: How do you kn ow that Big KAHUNA Frankie, New York City's seventh-biggest crime boss, is holding my SNAKE hostage?
DETECTIVE: (Smoking) It wasn't easy to find that out, even for a detective like me.
DETECTIVE: I had to BRIBE a lot of guys.
DETECTIVE: What can I say... if you follow the trail of pizza, and BRIBE enough guys... that's classic detective work.
DETECTIVE: I may not agree with your methods, and I don't like your ADJECTIVE NOSE, but it seems like I don't have a much of a choice, now, do I?
PIZZA GUY: Listen, man. If you help me get my SNAKE back from Big KAHUNA Frankie, I'll return all the JEWELS. I swear it.
PIZZA GUY: I don't even like JEWELS. I just like pizza.... and murder.
DETECTIVE: Seems like you and me have more alike than I thought.
DETECTIVE: (Taking hat and coat from rack) Let's hit the road. If the cops ask any questions... I'll BRIBE them. (Leave)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Leave with DETECTIVE)

Applause
GAMER: (Wave to audience) What's boppin, chat?
MODERATOR: And running independently, billionaire owner of the HoneyBear incorporated and the HoneyBear chocolate factory, John Bear.
Applause
JOHN: (Wave to audience) Ladies and gentlemen, is it my sweet, sweet pleasure to be here... or should I say, "BEE" here!
JOHN: Get it? Because I own a Honey company? (Laugh maniacally)
JOHN: Actually, HoneyBear Incorporated makes many candy products other than Honey. But that's neither here nor there--
JOHN: (Grandly) Let the tournament commence!
MODERATOR: Excuse me, sir.
MODERATOR: You may be the owner of the largest mega-corporation in the world,
MODERATOR: Which brings billions of pounds of delicious HONEY (and other candy products) to the children of the world,
MODERATOR: But in this debate room-- it is I, who am God.
JOHN: Tut tut, mister moderator! Don't forget who owns you... and your HOME!
MODERATOR: (Slightly scared) That might be so, but this is supposed to be a neutral setting for debate... and I am here to oversee it...
Meanwhile JOHN: (Mockingly imitate the MODERATOR's words)
JOHN: I OWN YOU!
Meanwhile MODERATOR: (Get scared) Ahh!
MODERATOR: (Scared, shaking) Um, y-yes, sorry, your candy-excellency.
MODERATOR: (Clearing throat) Ahem... Anyway... um...
JOHN: (Reminding) "Our first question is about candy..."
MODERATOR: Yes, yes, our first question is about candy.
MODERATOR: (Whispering to JOHN) Should I start with you, my lord?
JOHN: (Whispering to MODERATOR) No, it's fine, let "them" go first.
JOHN: (Whispering to MODERATOR) Then I will CRUSH them like a piece of hard candy beneath my feet.
MODERATOR: (To GAMER) XXSHADOWNINJAXX, what is your opinion on candy?
MODERATOR: Specifically, will you allow John Bear to distribute free candy to all the children of the nation?
USA anthem music
GAMER: (To audience) People of the United States of America... we have suffered too long at the hands of my opponent, John Bear, and his reign of corporate tyranny.
GAMER: Yes, he may be distributing free candy laced with ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE to the children of the world.
GAMER: But is all that ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE really free?
GAMER: If we were truly "free", we would be able to get our ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE from any ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE dealer we want.
GAMER: But I ask you, where are all the ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE dealers?
GAMER: What happened to them? One day, they were all just mysteriously... gone?
GAMER: If you ask me, that's a little sus.
GAMER: Now, I might just be an ordinary FORTNITE gamer. With the gamer tag XXSHADOWNINJAXX.
GAMER: But tonight, my cause is greater than any Victory Royale.
Gameshow buzzer
JOHN: Objection! Shut it down. FORTNITE was not on the approved list of topics for tonight's debate.
JOHN: Why not change the subject and talk about my newest line of LOLLIPOPS?
MODERATOR: Sure, let's take a quick break to talk about tonight's debate's sponsor, HoneyBear Incoporated, and their new product, ADJECTIVE LOLLIPOPS.
Badass music 1
JOHN: That's right, from the same lovable company that brought you SQUIGGLY SUCKERS,
JOHN: which also happens to be the same company that 90% of America works for and makes 90% of all products,
JOHN: comes a brand new candy! It's called ADJECTIVE LOLLIPOPS!
MODERATOR: Wow! I can't wait to try one of those LOLLIPOPS! I bet they're super ADJECTIVE!

JOHN: that is transcends the boundaries of reality.
JOHN: It's gonna tickle your little taste buds just right!

Peaceful fantasy music
WIZARD: Greetings, DEVOURER OF CHAOS, Sorcerer of the Ninth Realm.
SORCERER: Salutations, uh... I'm sorry, what was your name again? I'm terrible with names.
WIZARD: MERLIN. My name is MERLIN. We attended magic school together for like... 5 years.
SORCERER: Ah, PigFarts university. I remember it like it was a century ago.
WIZARD: Ha! I believe it was two centuries ago!
SORCERER: (Laughing) Who's counting! Haha!
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Laughing together)
SORCERER: Hey, can I ask you something? You ever turn your staff into a snake just for fun?
WIZARD: Just for fun? I guess you can say that. WINK! (Wink at SORCERER)
Alien teleport, Magic sound, Teleport HUMAN to CENTER STAGE
HUMAN: (Surprised, confused!) Wha--What happened? (Look around) Where am I?
HUMAN: (Thinking hard) The last thing I remember was... driving through a FRANCHISE drive-through?
HUMAN: (Looking around) And now I'm in a fantasy world full of... Wizards?
WIZARD: Greetings, good fellow! I am MERLIN, wizard of this realm.
SORCERER: And I am DEVOURER OF CHAOS, Sorcerer of the Ninth Realm.
HUMAN: I must have been Isekai-ed into a completely different universe!
HUMAN: I mean uh... "realm."
HUMAN: (Pointing) And is that a... MUSHROOM in the distance?
SORCERER: (Looking over shoulder) Oh yeah, the MUSHROOM. We have plenty of those here.
WIZARD: You're not from this realm, are you, stranger?
SORCERER: Does your world not have MUSHROOM?
HUMAN: No. But we do have FRANCHISE.
SORCERER: (Struggling to pronounce word) ...FRANCHISE? What manner of sorcery is that?
WIZARD: I think I know a spell called "Abra-ka-FRANCHISE".
SORCERER: Do you want to try it?
WIZARD: Couldn't hurt.
WIZARD: (Channeling a magical incantation) Abra-ka-FRANCHISE!
Meanwhile SORCERER: (Channeling a magical incantation) Abra-ka-FRANCHISE!
Thunder, Magic sound
Peaceful fantasy music
SORCERER: (Surprised) Oh! That's silly. (Feeling mouth) It turned my teeth into MATERIAL.
WIZARD: Fascinating! I shall write this down in my scroll. (Pull out a scroll and write in it)
HUMAN: Hmm, I was driving my VEHICLE through the FRANCHISE drive-through...
HUMAN: Have you wizards seen my VEHICLE come out of some kind of portal, or rift, or something?
WIZARD: VEHICLE? Indeed! A strange monstrosity labeled "VEHICLE" manifested itself in the forest just hours ago.
HUMAN: Where can I find it? Perhaps I can use it to return to my world.
WIZARD: Good luck with that. We saw a gang of goblins loot that VEHICLE almost immediately.
SORCERER: Looked like they were trying to convert it into some kind of battle-wagon tricked out with enchanted VEHICLE armor.
WIZARD: They're still working on it but believe me, so far, it looks pretty sick.
HUMAN: Darn. How am I going to get back to my Earth, now?
WIZARD: Earth? Why, you're standing on it, dear, boy! Ha! (Laugh to self)
SORCERER: (Laughing together) This poor chap doesn't even know the four elements of which our realm is composed! What a fool! Ha ha ha!
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Laugh together, mocking the HUMAN)
HUMAN: (Not amused) I do happen to know the elements, Wizards. In fact, I'm a chemistry student.
HUMAN: And on my planet, which is called EARTH, we have 118 elements.
SORCERER: Oh yeah? Name every element.
HUMAN: Okay. Uh, Hydrogen... Helium...
WIZARD: (Breaking out in laughter) "Helium!" Ha! You're definitely making that up.
Meanwhile SORCERER: (Break out in laughter and point at the HUMAN mockingly)
SORCERER: Ha! Every knows the four elements are Earth, Water, Fire, and ELEMENT!
HUMAN: You know what, I don't need this. I'm gonna go find a way back home.
SORCERER: Okay, chump! Good luck finding your way out of this forest with all the "CREATUREs" lurking about!
WIZARD: (Quietly to SORCERER) Shh, don't give him any hints.
HUMAN: You Wizards are real jerks (Start to leave, but hesitate) Wait... did you say CREATURE?
SORCERER: Why yes, there are CREATURE all throughout these woods!
SORCERER: Hiding behind every MUSHROOM, in fact!
HUMAN: Why do you say it like that? Should I be worried about these CREATUREs?
SORCERER: (Coy) I don't know... should you?
HUMAN: Well, when you say it like that, I'm not so sure I want to go venturing off without some protection...
HUMAN: Are you guys going to help me or what?
WIZARD: (Walk up to Human) You know, I feel bad for you, Human.
WIZARD: With your flimsy little arms and fragile BODY PART (Fiddle with HUMAN's BODY PART)
HUMAN: What's wrong with my BODY PART?
WIZARD: Allow me to cast a spell of moderate protection.
SORCERER: Yeah, that's fair. If you die, who will we mock for our amusement?
HUMAN: (Pondering) I've never been under a magic spell before.
HUMAN: Unless you count listening to SONG nonstop when I was in high school.
WIZARD: What a coincidence. That's exactly the incantation to this spell.
SORCERER: (Gather near the human) Let's begin the spell. Ready, MERLIN?
WIZARD: Ready, DEVOURER OF CHAOS.
WIZARD: (Chanting, waving arms around) SONG, SONG, SONG

Jazz music 1
JACOB: (Fiddling in kitchen) Did you eat all the PIZZA ROLLS?
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Sitting on couch playing on phone)
TREVOR: (Sitting on couch playing on phone) No way. I didn't eat what was left of your delicious PIZZA ROLLS.
JACOB: Are you sure? I could have sworn there were at least several PIZZA ROLLS left.
TREVOR: (Sitting on couch) Yeah yeah whatever. Hey man. Check out this pic. (Hold out cellphone)
Meanwhile JACOB: (Do stuff in the kicthen)
JACOB: (Shielding eyes, looking away) Oh no. Nope. Not falling for that again.
JACOB: (Wagging finger at TREVOR) Nuh uh
TREVOR: What? (Wiggle phone, invitingly) Come on, It's a funny pic, check this out.
JACOB: Last time you wanted to show me a so-called "funny pic", it was a picture of TERRIBLE THING.
TREVOR: Okay, I admin. That was highly uncool of me. Even if it was a little funny.
TREVOR: But I promise, this isn't like that. C'mon, check out this pic. It's worth it.
JACOB: (Disbelief) Oh yeah? What's it a picture of, then?
TREVOR: (Holding out phone and not even looking at it) It's... a picture of my PETANIMAL.
TREVOR: (Unconvincingly) It's... a meme of my PETANIMAL, actually!
JACOB: (Disbelief) What does this "Meme" say? What's the text on it?
TREVOR: I'm not gonna spoil it by reading it out loud. You have to see for yourself. That's the whole point.
JACOB: No! Before I commit to engaging with that meme, I need definitive proof that it's not a picture of TERRIBLE THING.
JACOB: Or anything else of that nature.
MARTHA: (Enter) What's all this commotion? And are there any PIZZA ROLLS left?
TREVOR: (To MARTHA) Hey, Martha. Check out this pic on my phone. (Hold out phone)
Meanwhile MARTHA: (Don't look at the phone just yet)
JACOB: (Urgently) DO NOT do it!
MARTHA: What's the matter? Why can't I just look at that pic?
JACOB: (Shielding MARTHA, whispering to her) It's a prank, it's probably a picture of HORRIBLE THING or something like that.
JACOB: Don't encourage this. Just ignore it. Save yourself. You're still pure. You can get away.
TREVOR: Don't listen to Jacob. He's just hangry for PIZZA ROLLS.
Meanwhile JACOB: (Gesture for MARTHA to leave the room)
TREVOR: (Pointing to phone) This is just a meme of my PETANIMAL. That's all. It's pretty funny.
TREVOR: So instead of questioning my motivations, why don't you check it out yourself? (Hold out phone)
JACOB: Martha, for the love of PIZZA ROLLS, if you value your eyeballs, don't look at that PETANIMAL meme.
MARTHA: You guys have some kind of problem you need to work out. I'm not sure I want to get involved.
JACOB: Thank you!
TREVOR: You know what? Don't look at this meme of my PETANIMAL.
TREVOR: It's not like I put a lot of time and effort into it.
TREVOR: Studying the greatest memes and learning from them to craft the perfect, witty, ironic meme.
TREVOR: Raising a PETANIMAL from birth. (Turn away sadly)
JACOB: (Throwing arms up in exasperation) Typical. This is so typical.
JACOB: (To MARTHA, but loud) This is classic Trevor-reverse-psychology.
JACOB: (Suddenly remembering) AND! Last time he said he raised a SNAKE. Remember the SNAKE thing?
JACOB: But it was all an elaborate excuse to get you to look at a video of a SNAKE IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
JACOB: (Up close to TREVOR) You're a sick individual.
TREVOR: (Holding up phone) Check it out.
Meanwhile JACOB: (Shield your eyes and don't look at the phone) No!
MARTHA: This is ridiculous. Now I'm super intrigued. I simply must see this PETANIMAL meme.
TREVOR: (Coy) You sure?
MARTHA: Yeah. Sure. Show me.
TREVOR: You trust me?
MARTHA: Yeah.
TREVOR: (To JACOB) See, Martha trusts me.
JACOB: (Facing away proudly) That's a mistake.
MARTHA: Oh, don't be such a coward. Besides, I'm so desensitized to videos of IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION at this point, who cares?
MARTHA: I've even made a few IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION memes myself.
MARTHA: (Grabbing TREVOR's phone) Let me see that.
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Martha takes your phone to look at it)
TREVOR: Check it out!
MARTHA: (Taking a moment to read the meme) Okay.
JACOB: (Watching in anticipation) Well? Did you fall for it?
MARTHA: I mean, it's just a picture of a PETANIMAL DOING STUFF.
MARTHA: And it has the caption, MEME CAPTION
JACOB: No way. Let me see this. (Grab phone from MARTHA and look at it)
MARTHA: It's true.
JACOB: (Reading meme out loud) MEME CAPTION.
JACOB: Well, I'll be GOBSMACKED and flabbergasted.
MARTHA: Nice meme, Trevor. (High five TREVOR)
Meanwhile TREVOR: (High five MARTHA)
JACOB: (Holding up phone) Okay. What's the catch with this?
TREVOR: (Coy) Jacob, my friend. There is virtually no catch. There's barely anything that should worry you.
JACOB: Well, I guess my day has been slightly improved by looking at this cute little PETANIMAL... (Thinking) wait a second!
JACOB: (Increasingly suspicious) Why are you being so coy? WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NOTHING SIGNIFICANT"?
JACOB: (Strangle TREVOR) WHAT DID YOU DO?
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Get strangled) Bleck! Gurk!
MARTHA: Stop! Let him go! (Pull JACOB away from TREVOR)
Meanwhile JACOB: (MARTHA pulls you away from TREVOR)
JACOB: (To TREVOR) Speak, you fiend.
TREVOR: (Maniacally) You cursed, my good fellow! By gazing upon the forbidden PETANIMAL, and speaking the incantation, you are cursed to die!
TREVOR: Cursed to die... in sixty seconds! (Evil laughter, highly amused)
MARTHA: What the heck, man!
JACOB: What kind of "The Ring" garbage is this? (To audience) Is this seriously the best conclusion the author of this skit could think of?
MARTHA: (To TREVOR) What's wrong with you? Why do this? What's your motivation?
TREVOR: (Serious) In a word.... "chaos."
JACOB: (Strangle TREVOR) You jerk! You lift this curse right now! Or I'll make you IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION!
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Getting strangled) There's nothing-- I can do-- !
MARTHA: (Looking at watch) Wait... it's definitely been at least a minute since we looked at the meme.
JACOB: (Stop strangling TREVOR) It's been a minute? And we're not dead?
JACOB: Perhaps... there is no curse?
TREVOR: (Laughing to self)
JACOB: (To TREVOR, playfully, laughing) Oh Trevor, you jerk. You had me all worried for nothing. Again!
MARTHA: (Laughing playfully) You really are a gullible little guy.
JACOB: (Sighing, putting arm around TREVOR) Classic Trevor.
MARTHA: (Looking at watch) But just to be safe, I think we should give it a few more seconds, though.
MARTHA: And if we're not dead by then, we can-- (YOU SUDDENLY DIE)
Church bell
Tense cinematic music
TREVOR: (Point and laugh at MARTHA's corpse) Hahaha! Another soul falls, in the name of PETANIMAL!
JACOB: (Increasingly building rage) Trevor... when I die... I'm going to haunt you so hard you will with you were never born!
JACOB: I'm gonna-- (YOU SUDDENLY DIE)
Church bell
Lacrimosa music
TREVOR: (Pick up phone from MARTHA's corpse, thinking to self) Now... what to make for my next cursed meme?
TREVOR: Oh I know... (typing on phone) I'll make a meme about SOMETHING

HOST: Patricia, whenever you're ready, take it away!

MOTHER: (Endearing) You've been such a good boy this year, Timmy. What would you like for your birthday!
CHILD: I want a pet doggy!
MOTHER: A dog? That's a big responsibility. Okay... but you have to promise to take care of that doggy!
CHILD: I will, I promise!
MOTHER: Make sure you always remember to feed it... "INEDIBLE OBJECT"...
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants) I said, remember to feed your dog "INEDIBLE OBJECT". (Pause for a moment)
CHILD: I will, mom!
MOTHER: (To CHILD) And always take it for a walk... after it eats the "INEDIBLE OBJECT"...
CHILD: Yeah! (Pause awkwardly)
HOST: Contestants, go ahead and ring in whenever you notice something wrong with this scene...
TREVOR: (Watch the actors really intensely for a second)
CHILD: Mommy, are dogs supposed to eat "INEDIBLE OBJECT"?
MOTHER: Why yes Timmy, INEDIBLE OBJECT is made specifically for dogs to eat, inside their mouths.
MOTHER: (Rub stomach, stare at contestants) Mmm, INEDIBLE OBJECT!
Music stops, Gameshow ring
TREVOR: (Point at actors) I know what's wrong.
TREVOR: You don't really need to walk your dog as long as you have enough CLEANING SUPPLIES.
TREVOR: And they have plenty of CLEANING SUPPLIES!
HOST: No, that's... (Utterly confused) What?

ALEXA: I don't like her face.
HOST: Here's a hint: It's something about the DOG FOOD.

TREVOR: INEDIBLE OBJECT doesn't go in your mouth, God gave you a specific hole for that.
HOST: Close enough. I guess you earn one point.
HOST: You people are weird. Okay, here's your next scenario.
HOST: Hopefully this one is a bit easier, but I doubt it, since that was the FIRST round...

CHILD: Mommy?
MOTHER: What is it, Timmy?
CHILD: Where do babies come from?
MOTHER: Well, you see, Timmy, when mommy and daddy love each other very much, they...
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants) go to CHAIN RESTAURANT and eat SPECIAL INGREDIENT.

HOST: That's not correct... seriously?

TREVOR: I'm pretty sure pregnancy only lasts 7 months, that's what my wife told me.
TREVOR: Which makes sense, because 9 months before our baby was born she was away on a business trip with her boss and his friends.
Gameshow ring
ALEXA: That's not her real son. The husband swapped out the babies at the hospital and she has no idea.
HOST: None of you are right, let's just move onto the next scenario.

MOTHER: (Speaking on phone) Hello, Domino's Pizza? I'd like to order one large pizza pepperoni pizza.
MOTHER: (Staring at contestants) Yes, and a 2 liter of pepsi...
CHILD: (Coughing, vomiting) Mommy... is there supposed to be blood?
MOTHER: Hang in there, Timmy, my son! I'm calling for help right now!
MOTHER: (Talking on phone, speaking very slowly) ... by calling DOMINO'S PIZZA.
MOTHER: (Talking on phone) Why yes, I'll hold...
Music stops, Gameshow ring
TREVOR: She's stupid, if you order on the Domino's app your get a much better deal.

WIFE: Jealous? Are you kidding? Stop turning this on me.
WIFE: Maybe I would support your decisions if they were less reckless, Daryl!

WIFE: (Trying not to blush) Oh stop it. You're just calling me PRETTY because I'm mad at you.
HUSBAND: (Brushing her hair) How mad are you? Do you want to CHOKE me?
WIFE: (Coy) Maybe I do want to CHOKE you after all you've put me through today.
HUSBAND: (Exiting stage left) Why don't we go upstairs and you can get your revenge for all my... IRRESPONSIBLE THING?
Meanwhile WIFE: (Follow the HUSBAND)
WIFE: (Exiting stage left with HUSBAND) (Flirtatiously) we can try the DOWNWARD DOG position.

AGENT: (Pacing around nervously) It's Friday. This is not good. I should have heard from headquarters by now.
AGENT: If I don't receive a message by the end of the day, my mission to DO GOOD DEED could be a complete failure.
AGENT: Was the pizza delivery last night a secret message in disguise? If so, I might have eaten it by accident.
AGENT: (Peek out the window) No sign of any friendly agents. Maybe something went wrong.
AGENT: (Noticing someone outside) Wait a moment. Who's that walking up to the house?
AGENT: Is that....?!
Doorbell
AGENT: (Calling out) One moment!
AGENT: Hmm. This could be a trap. Better take up a tactical position. (Hide behind the couch and point your gun at the door
Doorbell
AGENT: (Calling out) Come on in, the door's open!
MAILMAN: (Enter stage right) Hello? Are you sure it's okay to come inside? This is highly unconventional.
MAILMAN: (Noticing the agent) Oh, hello. I see you have a gun. I'll just be leaving now.
AGENT: Oh, this? It's just a... toy gun.
AGENT: (Lying) You see, I'm a famous movie star named FAMOUS ACTOR. You may have heard of me.
MAILMAN: FAMOUS ACTOR? Never heard of you. But that explanation makes perfect sense.
AGENT: It's my fool-proof-- I mean, totally accurate backstory.
MAILMAN: (Holding a package) Well, FAMOUS ACTOR, I am here to deliver this very important package.
AGENT: A package you say? Well, I have been expecting to receive something today.
AGENT: (Whispering to self) Perhaps this is a message from headquarters in disguise....
MAILMAN: What are you saying? I can't hear you.
AGENT: Oh, nothing. So, do I have to sign for the package or something?
MAILMAN: Let me just confirm your identity real quick.

AGENT: (Whispering to self) I didn't order any ORDERABLE ITEM... headquarters must have sent this.
AGENT: (To mail person) Yes, that's my ORDERABLE ITEM.
AGENT: You see, my old ORDERABLE ITEM broke when I tried to use it to REPAIR THING.

AGENT: (Answering phone) Who is this?
NARRATOR: Agent CODENAME, is that you?
AGENT: That depends. Who's asking? Who are you?
NARRATOR: My name is not important. What is important is that you do not open that package.

NARRATOR: Listen closely. That ORDERABLE ITEM contains a CHEMICAL bomb that's set to explode in 60 seconds.

AGENT: What am I supposed to do with this?
NARRATOR: That's for you to figure out. Goodbye, agent CODENAME.
AGENT: (Putting away the phone) They hung up. Darn. Now what am I going to do?

Aww
INTERN: That doesn't seem so bad. At least we earned a profitable amount of CURRENCY, right?

WANDERER: Why did I have to wander off like this? I knew I should have stayed with the group.
WANDERER: Now I'm all alone, lost in this creepy forest... who knows what could happen out here?
SALESPERSON: (Enter) Don't worry, my good fellow. I'm here to help you.
WANDERER: Who are you? Were you following me?
SALESPERSON: Oh no, I was just happening to wander these woods myself and I overheard your predicament.
SALESPERSON: As for who I am, you can call me Elric the Elf.
WANDERER: Well, what do you want from me, Elric the Elf?
SALESPERSON: I happen to have something that might interest you greatly.
SALESPERSON: It's an insurance policy, specifically designed for travelers like yourself who find themselves lost in the forest.
WANDERER: An insurance policy? Is that really necessary?
WANDERER: Besides, I don't have much money on me right now.
SALESPERSON: Ah, but can you really put a price on peace of mind?
SALESPERSON: You're lucky it was I who appeared in the middle of these woods, and not something more sinister...
SALESPERSON: But with this policy, you'll be protected against all sorts of unforeseen dangers and mishaps.
WANDERER: I don't know... I spent all my money on BUYABLE ITEM and my parents won't increase my allowance.
SALESPERSON: It's a very reasonably priced policy. And the benefits highly outweigh the costs.
SALESPERSON: Allow me to elaborate. (Point at the floor)
SALESPERSON: What if you encounter a pit full of CREATUREs? If you fall in, well, you can imagine what might happen.
WANDERER: Oh. Would you say there are many pits full of CREATURE in the woods?
SALESPERSON: Most certainly! And what about a group of TYPE OF PERSON people, who prey on strangers in broad daylight?
WANDERER: Good heavens! I had no idea that TYPE OF PERSON posed that kind of danger!
SALESPERSON: Sorry to scare you, but yes, it's very true.
SALESPERSON: You may also wish to know that NUMBER percent of people who get lost in the woods fall victim to ILLNESS.
WANDERER: Really? ILLNESS? Out in these woods?
SALESPERSON: Of course, ILLNESS is mostly linked to genetics.... (Lean in to tell a secret)
SALESPERSON: But between you and me, I suspect a strong correlation between ILLNESS and FUN ACTIVITY here in the woods.
WANDERER: FUN ACTIVITY in these very woods? Now why would I be doing that?
SALESPERSON: You might come across a TYPE OF PERSON who wants to FUN ACTIVITY. You know, peer pressure.
WANDERER: I suppose if I saw a TYPE OF PERSON doing FUN ACTIVITY then I might be inclined to join in...
SALESPERSON: Exactly! So you'll want an insurance policy to protect you in the event of FUN ACTIVITY ILLNESS.
WANDERER: Well when you put it like that, I would be silly not to have insurance. Where do I sign?
SALESPERSON: Well, it's such a popular policy that I ran out of scrolls.
SALESPERSON: But for now, you can sign my BODY PART. Here's a pen! (Hold out a pen)
WANDERER: (Take the pen and sign the BODY PART) There you go!

TYPEWRITER: Court Case #112389;Becky Brown v. David Dickson
BAILIFF: All rise for the honorable Judge NAME!
JUDGE: (enter stage and sit on judge's chair)
(Music stops)
JUDGE: You may be seated.
BAILIFF: Hello, your honor. This is the case of Brown vs. Dickson. 
JUDGE: Thank you, officer. Lets see... (look over files) It says here that Ms. Becky Brown insists that Mr. David Dickson is the father of her AGE month old child.
JUDGE: However, Mr. Dickson claims the kid isn't his.
JUDGE: Ms. Brown, please give the court a brief history on your relationship with Mr. Dickson.
BECKY: (stand up) Yes, your honor. David and I met back in high school and we were sweethearts until a little over AGE months ago. 
BECKY: I'm not sure what happened, but David didn't seem to love me as much when I became pregnant. 
DAVID: That's because you've been sleeping around!
BECKY: I have not! That's not true!
JUDGE: (bang gavel) There will be order in this court! Ms. Brown, please continue.
BECKY: We had been married for about a year, and then David decided to file for divorce days after I told him we we're gonna start a family!
BECKY: I believe he's just avoiding the responsibility of raising child. (sit down)
JUDGE: Mr. Dickson, what is your statement?
DAVID: (stand up) I'm not going to take care of a child that isn't mine. Becky cheated on me!
DAVID: I left for a business trip, and I came back to a positive pregnancy test.
BECKY: Oh PET, do you not remember that night we had together before you left? We were going for HOURS hours!
DAVID: But we've discussed many times that we aren't ready for kids!
BECKY: How do I know you didn't leave to cheat on me then? You've never left on a business trip before!
DAVID: I got a promotion!
BECKY: You work at WORK!
JUDGE: (bang gavel) Order! Order in my court please. Mr. Dickson, is there any further reason why you believe this child isn't yours?
DAVID: Like I just said, Becky and I have talked about how we wanted to wait to have kids many times.
DAVID: We had just moved to CITY, got new jobs, and we wanted to have enough money saved up first. 
DAVID: Plus, even though our date nights would get a little "involved" sometimes, we were always sure to be safe. (sit down)
JUDGE: Well, anything can happen, no matter how safe you think you're being. This is where the DNA test comes in. 
JUDGE: Bailiff, please retrieve the results.
BAILIFF: Yes, your honor. (leave stage)
BECKY: I just want my husband back. I miss the love we had.
DAVID: I bet you miss our love because the real father doesn't want to take care of the kid either. 
BECKY: I told you a thousand times, I didn't cheat!
DAVID: (sarcastically) Yeah, right. I've seen how you look at the neighbor.
BAILIFF: (return to stage, hand imaginary folder to judge) The results, your honor.
JUDGE: (take imaginary folder from bailiff) Thank you. These results were prepared by DNA Diagnostics, and they read as follows...
JUDGE: In the case of Brown v. Dickson, when it comes to the AGE month old child, it has been determined by this court.....
JUDGE: Mr. David Dickson, you........
JUDGE: ANSWER the father.

Detective Pikachu: Making the streets of this city wet and runny, Just how I like my COFFEE
Detective Pikachu: We've been getting fewer cases as of late, but a detective never surrenders to the sounds of silence-
Detective Pikachu: only more alert for the next case, another puzzle to solve in this part of town in Ryme City.
Detective Pikachu: *Walks towards the desk and sits*
Detective Pikachu: Say- Where's my partner Tim?
Detective Pikachu: He was supposed to be back here hours ago with my cup of COFFEE.
Detective Pikachu: Hope he's all okay, I hope he didn't fall into some MUD on his way back.
(Knocking on door)
Detective Pikachu: Come in, door's open
Tim: *opens the door and walks in *
Pokemon: * walks in with Tim*

Detective Pikachu: *Gets up from the chair and looks into the cup*
Pokemon: *Jumps out of cup* SNOM! *Runs around*

(Silly music 2)
Pokemon: SNOM! SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: What the?! A SNOM!?
Tim: I found this LITTLE SNOM on the streets looking sad and worried, so I thought maybe we could help it out.
Detective Pikachu: So wait, No COFFEE?
Tim: ahh, well *Looks away*
Detective Pikachu: Did the SNOM drink all my COFFEE?! *Points to the Pokemon in anger*
Pokemon: *shakes head* SNOM SNOM SNOM!
Tim: No no, it's just when I was heading back to the office I bumped into someone and all the COFFEE fell into the MUD.
(Lacrimosa Music)
Detective Pikachu: Noooooo, I was looking forward to drinking that COFFEE.
Tim: Pikachu you have been drinking too much COFFEE these past few days, thats not right.
(Shark Tank positive music)
Detective Pikachu: Your right, sorry. No use crying over spilled COFFEE. 
Detective Pikachu: Besides, right now we have an SNOM in need.
Detective Pikachu: *Walks up to the Pokemon* So, what happened to you? 
Pokemon: SNOM SNOM SNOM, SNOM SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: *Nods* Mhm and then?
Pokemon: SNOM SNOM, SNOM SNOM!
Pokemon: *feeling sad* SNOM SNOM.
Tim: Uhh, What is it saying?
Detective Pikachu: *Looks at Tim* It seems like this LITTLE SNOM here lost its partner and doesn't know where to go.
Pokemon: SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: It was asleep till it woke up from a fall and was dazed for quite a bit.
Detective Pikachu: Then you came along and the rest is history.
Tim: Can it describe what its partner looks like, maybe I saw them while I was out.

(Anime sword gleam 1)
Detective Pikachu: *Gasp*
Detective Pikachu: ) *Looks at the audience, Claps, and points up* A Bolt of Brilliance! I know where your partner is LITTLE SNOM.
(Noir music 3)
Tim: Really? Do you know where they are?
Detective Pikachu: I'm surprised you didn't pick up on it too Tim. 
Detective Pikachu: You went out to get me my large cup of COFFEE.
Detective Pikachu: And since my order of COFFEE was so large you've probably focused your attention more on not spilling the COFFEE than on your surroundings.
Detective Pikachu: Around the same time SNOM's TALL BEARD partner was too tired to see where they were walking and bumped into you.
Detective Pikachu: Not only spilling my delicious COFFEE but also knocking SNOM off of its partner in the process.
Tim: But if all that was true then where would SNOM's partner be?
Detective Pikachu: *walks towards the door* Where else do I go to get my fix to wake me up?
Detective Pikachu: At the CAFE SHOP!
Tim: This better not be an excuse to get more COFFEE
Detective Pikachu: Trust me, Tim. This Detective is never wrong.
Detective Pikachu: *leaves through the door*

CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Cackle like a goblin) I THIRST FOR BLOOD.
DUNGEON MASTER: Very good. Last we left off, you were following a MYTHICAL CREATURE into an enchanted glade, when suddenly, you got lost!
NEWBIE PLAYER: I recall! Our MYTHICAL CREATURE guide suddenly disappeared, that rascal! I hope it returns soon.
BORED PLAYER: Huh? I don't remember that.
DUNGEON MASTER: Maybe because you spent the entire last session playing MOBILE GAME on your phone.
BORED PLAYER: (Shrug and play games on your phone) Not my fault MOBILE GAME is more entertaining than your dumb game.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: No! It's gone?! But I was going to pickpocket the MYTHICAL CREATURE and steal its TREASURE while it wasn't looking!
DUNGEON MASTER: I already told you, you can't do that. It's impossible.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: But I rolled a 20! Fine, can I steal its BODY PART when it comes back and sell it back in town?
DUNGEON MASTER: Also impossible. Besides, that would initiate combat. Are you sure you want to do that?
NEWBIE PLAYER: No, no! We're only level 1, and that MYTHICAL CREATURE is supposed to be our guide through these woods.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: And look where it's gotten us! We're lost! We should have killed it while it was WACKY ACTION.
BORED PLAYER: This sucks. I'm bored. I'm ordering a pizza. (Put your phone to your ear) Hi, Instant Pizza? I'd like to place an order.
DUNGEON MASTER: Hey! It's not that boring! Now look, you're lost in a magical wood. It's foggy and there's no signs of civilization. What do you do?

DUNGEON MASTER: You see a path through the woods surrounded by SOMETHING ZANY and thick spider webs. You also see odd tracks in the mud.
NEWBIE PLAYER: (Point to BORED PLAYER) You there, you're a ranger! Do you recognize these odd tracks? Do they belong to the MYTHICAL CREATURE that was guiding us?
BORED PLAYER: (Look up from your phone) Uh, how should I know?
DUNGEON MASTER: You can roll a Survival check, you INSULT.
BORED PLAYER: You're the INSULT, INSULT. (Roll some dice)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: I set the giant spider webs on fire then do a triple front flip somersault through them!
DUNGEON MASTER: Wait your turn, Rogue. Ranger, what was your roll?
Knocking on door
BORED PLAYER: Who cares? Pizza's here. (Walk to the door and open it)
PIZZA GUY: Hi, Instant Pizza! Hot, fresh, ADJECTIVE pizza delivered to your door instantaneously. Sorry I'm late. Here's your pizza with extra TOPPING!
BORED PLAYER: No prob, dude. Come put it on the table. (Walk back to the table)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Follow BORED PLAYER back to the table)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: I changed my mind. I push the wizard into the spider webs!
DUNGEON MASTER: Uhh, ok. Roll Athletics.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Roll some dice) 13! Did I do it? Is the wizard going to be eaten!? (Point at NEWBIE PLAYER) I hope they lay eggs in you! Mwahaha!
NEWBIE PLAYER: You greatly disturb me, Rogue. Dungeon master, can't I dodge or something?
PIZZA GUY: Oh cool, you guys are playing D&D? I'm a dungeon master myself. (Set the pizza down)
DUNGEON MASTER: (Point at Pizza Guy) Yes, and you're very rudely interrupting our game! 
DUNGEON MASTER: Alright Wizard, the Rogue pushes you into the spider webs. Four giant Phase Spiders suddenly appear around you, gnashing their teeth hungrily.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: Yes! Feast upon his squishy magic BODY PART! Mwahaha!
NEWBIE PLAYER: What's with you and your obsession with BODY PARTs?
PIZZA GUY: Wait, doesn't the wizard get to contest the roll?
DUNGEON MASTER: Huh? Contest the roll?
PIZZA GUY: Well that was a shove. According to page 195 of the Player's Handbook, the wizard gets to roll Athletics or Acrobatics to contest the rogue's check.
NEWBIE PLAYER: I do?
DUNGEON MASTER: They do? I mean, yes of course. I knew that! I was just getting to that before you interrupted me.
DUNGEON MASTER: Fine, you can roll, but don't use those metal dice again, or-
Meanwhile NEWBIE PLAYER: (Roll some dice)
Crashing debris
NEWBIE PLAYER: 14. Do I win?
DUNGEON MASTER: (Tired) No, the spider webs are too sticky and- (look at Pizza Guy as you're talked over)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Loud) Yeah! 14 is higher than 13, so the Rogue fails to push you. Congrats, you're not stuck in the spider webs!
DUNGEON MASTER: Excuse me, but this is my table. You can't just come in here and decide what happens! Make your own game if you want to be the DM.
NEWBIE PLAYER: I don't know, I kind of like the new guy. He kept me from getting eaten by spiders.
BORED PLAYER: He brought us pizza too, so I like him.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: He foiled my plans, but... Hey, pizza guy! You know stuff about this game! Tell me, is it really impossible to steal a BODY PART from a MYTHICAL CREATURE?
PIZZA GUY: Well sure it's possible. There's rules for harvesting body parts, crafting them into magic items, stuff like that. It's all in the books.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You liar! How dare you deprive me of MYTHICAL CREATURE BODY PART?
NEWBIE PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You would've let me die if the pizza guy didn't correct you! I cast SPELL on you!
BORED PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You keep distracting me from grinding in MOBILE GAME with dice rolls and silly voices.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Look at NEWBIE PLAYER.) Mutiny? (Quick nod. Grab DUNGEON MASTER and drag him out the door)

Brain: Quick Pinky, President NICKSON is outside the door. Put on this disguise and pretend to be a nurse.
Brain: Wait, Pinky are you pondering what I'm pondering
Pinky: I think so brain, But I'm not sure how an Oprah singing GHOST that's BOWING would help us with winning the next bingo night.
Brain: No pinky, it's just that I realized you have no experience in the medical field.
Brain: I must perform the surgery myself *puts on disguise*

KAIJU: (Incredibly nervous) My name is NAME, and my occupation is giant sea monster off the coast of Japan.
KAIJU: Although, you guys shrunk me down, so being giant doesn’t matter currently.

Meanwhile GOOD COP: (Noting whatever the Kaiju says down)
KAIJU: That’s when the Navy thought it would be GREAT to drop a warhead on me. Talk about an alarm clock.

BOBBY: (Offended) Who are you calling dim wit?
BOBBY: (Proud) I scored 110% on Mr. Gottfried's GEOGRAPHY test!
CHRIS: (Raising hand) I forget why I'm here, too. Can you give us refresher?
CHRIS: I'm gonna be late for FOOTBALL practice!
TEACHER: You all are being punished for what you did to the school mascot, FRUMPY the DRAGON.
ALICE: That stupid DRAGON had it coming.
CHRIS: FRUMPY the DRAGON looked at me funny. And as the most "badass" kid in school, I can't let that slide.
ALICE: So we PRANK. It had to be done.
CHRIS: It has to be done, it had to be PRANK.
TEACHER: (Sigh) Which is why our school specifically has a policing against PRANK.

Noir Music 3 
MISS SCARLETT: (Looking around) Well, the air certainly is Charged tonight, isn't it? There's nothing like a good storm to set the mood for unraveling a mystery. 
PROFESSOR PLUM: Indeed, Detective. The Unseasonable demise of our dear Mr. NOUN9 leaves us with many questions.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Most pressing: who among us is the perpetrator of this vile deed?
MRS. PEACOCK: (fan yourself with a clue card) It's all quite unbearable to think that one of us could be capable of murder. I feel like I could faint at the very notion! 
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Pound your fist on the table) Enough of this dilly-dallying! I say we get to the bottom of this. 
COLONEL MUSTARD: Someone here is the murderer.
COLONEL MUSTARD: And I won't rest until we've sniffed 'em out!
MISS SCARLETT: I agree, Colonel. Let us begin our inquiry. Please, everyone, take a moment to recall your Whereabouts at the time of Mr. NOUN9's unfortunate... accident.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Well, I was in the NOUN1—entirely engrossed in a fascinating volume about NOUN2. The time simply slipped away from me.
MISS SCARLETT: You'll have to enlighten me about this NOUN2 after our mystery, Mr. Plum.
MRS. PEACOCK: And I was having a delightful conversation in the NOUN3. The orchids there are just divine this time of year.
COLONEL MUSTARD: I was in the NOUN4, engaging in a bit of solitary practice. No one can accuse me of cheating when I was alone the whole time!
MISS SCARLETT: Yes, well, we shall see if your alibis hold up. Now let's examine the available evidence. Where exactly was Mr. NOUN9 found?
PROFESSOR PLUM: His body was in the NOUN5, right on the floor. Poor chap.
MISS SCARLETT: And the murder weapon?
MRS. PEACOCK: (Gasping) Oh, it was something dreadful—a NOUN6, if you can believe it! Such a lovely piece, turned into an instrument of death.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Inspecting the cards) And what of the fingerprint analysis and the footprints? We can't overlook any detail, no matter how small.
MISS SCARLETT: Precisely, Colonel. Now, we all had access to a NOUN6, and it could easily have been transported to the NOUN5.
MISS SCARLETT:  We must scrutinize our evidence and interrogate one another until cracks in our stories are revealed.
TYPEWRITER: After lots of discoveries later
Shark Tank serious music 1
MISS SCARLETT: (Holding up a notepad) Now, let's recount our discoveries. Colonel Mustard, you claim to have been in the NOUN4. 
MISS SCARLETT: But a torn matchbook from the lounge was found in your Jacket. Care to explain?
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Stammering) Well, yes, I... I might have stopped by the NOUN1. But for a harmless drink! It means nothing, I assure you.
PROFESSOR PLUM: (Intrigued) A drink, you say? Or perhaps to pick up a handy NOUN6?
MRS. PEACOCK: But let's not forget the NOUN8 found beside the flowerpot in the conservatory.
MRS. PEACOCK: This means somebody could have used to stroll through the secret passage to the NOUN3.
MISS SCARLETT: (Eyeing Mrs. Peacock) A valid point. The secret passages aren't common knowledge, Mrs. Peacock. Your familiarity is... curious.
MRS. PEACOCK: (Whispering to themself) This is not how it was supposed to...
MISS SCARLETT: (Overhearing) Something you’d like to share with the group, Mrs. Peacock?
PROFESSOR PLUM: And let's not overlook the NOUN7 found in NOUN3—a perfect tool for a... scholarly type to utilize in a violent manner.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Nodding) Ah, Professor, were you not alone with your precious books around the time of the... incident?
MISS SCARLETT: (Tapping the notepad) We've had our share of bluffs and deflections. It's time we cut through the noise. 
MISS SCARLETT: The NOUN7 was also found dusted with ash—suggesting it was recently near the fireplace here in this very room.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Pointedly) Well then, Detective, it seems you're the only one without a suspect item tied to 'em. How do we know it wasn't you?
MISS SCARLETT: (Smiling slightly) Because, dear Colonel, unlike our hidden assailant, I do not stand to gain from Mr. NOUN9's untimely demise. 
MISS SCARLETT: And my fingerprints were not found on the murder weapon.
MISS SCARLETT: The NOUN8, the NOUN7, the scattered pages from Mr. NOUN9's diary—all of these paint a damning picture. It is time for the culprits to reveal themselves.
MISS SCARLETT: (Slowly) And that person is...
MISS SCARLETT: (With finality) Mrs. Peacock!

Noir music 4
MRS. PEACOCK: (Shocked) Me? Oh, Detective, surely you jest! How could you possibly think that I, a lady of my standing, could commit such a heinous act?
MISS SCARLETT: (Raising an eyebrow) The clues do not lie, Mrs. Peacock. Yes, everyone had access to a NOUN6, but not everyone had a motive.
MISS SCARLETT: The torn page from the guestbook found near the body contained a cryptic message in your handwriting.
MISS SCARLETT: And the orchid you so admire—its specific pollen was found on Mr. NOUN9's cuff.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Quite the deduction, Detective. It's always the details that give the game away.
COLONEL MUSTARD: And what about the footprints leading to the NOUN3? A distinctive tread pattern that matches none other than Mrs. Peacock's heels!
MRS. PEACOCK: This is preposterous! I've been framed! I would never soil my hands with such... such...
MISS SCARLETT: ...guilt? I do believe you protested a tad too much throughout our investigation. 
MISS SCARLETT: The truth always emerges, Mrs. Peacock. As they say, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Nodding with satisfaction) Splendid work, Detective. Justice will be served tonight.
MRS. PEACOCK: It... It was the money, you see. Mr. NOUN9 threatened to cut me off, to reveal my little... indiscretions. I couldn't allow that.
MISS SCARLETT: (Sympathetically) A tragic end to a desperate measure.
Knocking on door
POLICEMAN: Detective Scarlet, we received your call. Is this the suspect?
MISS SCARLETT: (Nods) Yes, officer. Take her into custody.
POLICEMAN: (Handcuffs Mrs. Peacock) Put your hands behind your back, Mrs. Peacock, you're going away for a long time.
Meanwhile MRS. PEACOCK: (Puts her hands behind her back as she gets cuffed)
POLICEMAN: (Walks out of the room with Mrs. Peacock)
Meanwhile MRS. PEACOCK: (Walks out of the room with the policeman) Let me go! These are just filthy liars!
MISS SCARLETT: Another case closed, thanks to deduction and attention to detail. Although, let's hope our next gathering is under less... murderous circumstances.

GENE SISBON: So now, we have only two celebrities left playing for charity - and it's a real barn-burner.

MEAT: (disapproving to ARTHUR:) A VEGCOL VEGET?
DATEE: Are you going to tell me, that I shouldn't have VEGCOL VEGET?
MEAT: Well, I know many VEGET that are very clear on that point.
MEAT: Which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem
MEAT: and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. And here I am.

MODERATOR: Welcome to debate number NUMBER of the next United States presidential election!

MODERATOR: This year’s candidates are still running neck-and-neck in the polls, so this is their last chance to make their case.
MODERATOR: So, let’s get right to it. First, please join me in extending a warm welcome to our first candidate, Senator NAME 1!

CANDIDATE 1: Thank you! Thank you all.
MODERATOR: And on the opposite side of the political spectrum, let’s give it up for our second candidate, Governor NAME 2!
applause
CANDIDATE 2: Good evening, everyone! Thank you for voting for me!

MODERATOR: Now let’s not get ahead of ourselves, but let’s get right to it.
MODERATOR: Senator NAME 1, do you support POLITICAL ISSUE?
CANDIDATE 1: Well, I have friends who support POLITICAL ISSUE, and I have friends who oppose POLITICAL ISSUE.
CANDIDATE 1: And if you want to know where I stand – I stand with my friends!

CANDIDATE 1: That’s right.

MODERATOR: Okay then. Governor NAME 2. Do you support war or peace?
CANDIDATE 2: Well, that depends on what you mean. 
CANDIDATE 2: Like, what do you really mean when you say “war”? And, are you talking about “peace peace,” or just about “PEACEFUL THING”?
MODERATOR: You may define the terms however you like.
CANDIDATE 2: So, there’s the question. War or peace? Peace or war? What really matters is what you stand for.
MODERATOR: “What really matters is what you stand for.” Profound indeed. May we quote you on that?
CANDIDATE 2: Absolutely.
applause
MODERATOR: Great. Okay. So now let’s get down to the things that really set you apart. Senator NAME 1 – FOOD 1 or FOOD 2?
CANDIDATE 1: FOOD 1.
MODERATOR: And Senator NAME 2, same question for you. FOOD 1 or FOOD 2?
CANDIDATE 2: FOOD 2. Definitely.
MODERATOR: So, there you have it, folks. A clear distinction. Now for the twist – what about voters who don’t like either FOOD 1 or FOOD 2, but like FOOD 3 instead?
CANDIDATE 1: That's what third parties are for.
CANDIDATE 2: I agree. Let those people vote for somebody else.
MODERATOR: Wow – bipartisan agreement. What a tough choice this election year is going to be!
applause
MODERATOR: Okay, the next question is to Senator NAME 1. What would you sell your soul for?
CANDIDATE 1: Um, I'm afraid that ship's already sailed.
MODERATOR: Excuse me?
CANDIDATE 1: Yeah, sorry, I have nothing left to sell.
MODERATOR: Well then. Governor NAME 2, what about you? What would you sell your soul for?
CANDIDATE 2: Actually, I've already taken out one primary mortgage on my soul, and I've already taken out two soul equity loans, so there's that. 
MODERATOR: So basically, you're an all-in candidate. In for a penny, in for a pound, is that right?
CANDIDATE 2: Yes, that's right. Once I set my mind to something, I'll do anything to get it done.
applause
MODERATOR: Very good, both of you. So, let’s get to closing statements. Senator NAME 1, why should the American people vote for you?
CANDIDATE 1: My fellow Americans, for too long, FOOD 2 has dominated the culinary landscape. 
CANDIDATE 1: Don’t you think it’s high time that FOOD 1 is mandated to be offered by every restaurant and cafeteria in our country?
CANDIDATE 1: A vote for NAME 1 is a vote for FOOD 1.
MODERATOR: Very persuasive. Governor NAME 2, your turn. Why should the American people vote for you instead?
CANDIDATE 2: I can think of one very good reason.
CANDIDATE 2: Because VERY GOOD REASON.

Gabriel: Oh, you're in for a treat. Gather 'round, my friend.
Gabriel: So, there's this legend about the MONSTERNAME, a monster that lurks in the shadows, feeding off the fear of children.
Gabriel: Legend has it that it's been terrorizing the nearby town for centuries.
Cassidy: (laughs nervously) Nice try, Gabriel. But monsters aren't real.
Gabriel: You say that now. But listen closely. The MONSTERNAME has a favorite haunt—SCHOOLNAME.
Gabriel: Every night, it sneaks into the school and hides in the HIDINGPLACE, waiting for unsuspecting children.
Cassidy: (leaning in) Seriously? That's a bit much, don't you think?
Gabriel: Oh, it gets better. The monster has this bone-chilling SOUND that echoes through the hallways. They say it loves to scare kids just for the thrill of it.

Gabriel: (points at MONSTERNAME) yeah, and me too!
Monster: What? Scare children? I would never do that! Who told you that?
Gabriel: Uhh... I heard it on the news back in TOWN. So you don't scare them? What do you do then?
Monster: You and all that news got it all wrong. I'm not evil. I just love a good FOOD.
Monster: I go into those schools to find some FOOD because it's delicious! I also love sharing FOOD with the children too!
Monster: In fact, I used to be a human myself! Before an evil witch turned me into a monster.
Gabriel: Huh. This is interesting.

Witch: (Walks in and cackles evilly) Greetings puny humans! (Turns to MONSTERNAME) Oh MONSTERNAME, It seems like you have some new friends!

VILLAIN: Another day, another chance at accomplishing my dreams. Let's try this blasted thing once more...
Meanwhile MONSTER: (Sleep on the floor)
VILLAIN: ARISE, MY CREATION! We have a world to conquer! (Laugh maniacally)
MONSTER: (Growl a bit) Am awake...
MONSTER: (Get up) ...Why is ANIMAL here again?
VILLAIN: (Evil chuckle) Oh my dear NAME1.
VILLAIN: You, my beloved creation, have been specifically designed by me to pose a threat to that dreadful NAME2 and their little friends.
VILLAIN: As for your animalistic appearance, I simply adore ANIMALs! They're so ADJECTIVE!
MONSTER: Oh. Ok. NAME1 hungry. Can NAME1 go eat?
VILLAIN: Later. You'll get your meal when you go out and wreak havoc! That will surely draw NAME2 out for YOU to destroy!
MONSTER: Why doesn't Master destroy?
VILLAIN: DEARLY NO- erm- (clears throat)
VILLAIN: No. Someone has to stay back and make sure things go according to plan, NAME1! Hehe!
MONSTER: Ok. NAME1 will wreck things, now. (Begin wrecking the place)
VILLAIN: Yes! Go my minion! Destroy everything!
VILLAIN: ...Hopefully they don't get blown up in the process. Like the others...
VILLAIN: (Exit the stage)

HERO: (Run onto stage) That must be NAME5's new monster!
Meanwhile SIDEKICK: (Follow the hero onto the stage)
SIDEKICK: When will they grow tired and leave us alone, already?
HERO: I don't know, NAME3, but one thing's for sure! We have to stop it from destroying everything!
MONSTER: (Roar at the heroes) There you are! NAME1 waited long time to fight you!
HERO: Sure... Okay! Let's do this thing! ATTACK1 (Strike the monster with your attack)
Meanwhile SIDEKICK: (Help NAME2 fight NAME1.)
MONSTER: Not good enough! (Strike at the heroes)
HERO: (Get knocked back from the attack)
Meanwhile SIDEKICK: (Get knocked back from the attack)
HERO: N-no way! It's resisting our attacks! (Regain your footing)
SIDEKICK: How are we going to beat it now?
HERO: We just keep pushing forward! Hopefully it deals some damage! (Attack once more)
MONSTER: Heroes boring. NAME1 done wrecking things here.

CIVILIAN: (Enter the stage while holding a bag of food.)
CIVILIAN: Hey. Got you two some sandwiches. You deal with the monster yet?
HERO: Sadly, It got away. (Look down at the ground)
HERO:...NAME4, this new monster has proven pretty... difficult... to beat.
CIVILIAN: Really? How so? Attacks won't hurt it?
HERO: Exactly. Nothing we did seemed to leave a scratch on it.
CIVILIAN: Hm... That doesn't sound good. (Go into thought while eating your sandwich)
CIVILIAN: Well, I've seen tons of TV shows, and I think I have an idea of what to do.
SIDEKICK: Really? What is it?
CIVILIAN: In those shows, the monster usually had a glaring weakness the heroes exploited.
CIVILIAN: Maybe the monster has a weakness?
HERO: Of course! But what would it be!
CIVILIAN: Well, did the monster look like some kind of animal?
SIDEKICK: A(n) ANIMAL, I think?
HERO: Bingo! That must have something to do with its weakness!
CIVILIAN: Or it could be something random, like WEAKNESS, or something.
HERO: ...There is most certainly a more logical weakness.
SIDEKICK: Well, it wouldn't hurt to try it out. If we fail, we could just brainstorm a bit more.
CIVILIAN: Yeah. Doubt it'd actually be WEAKNESS, but it'd be hilarious if it actually was.
Meanwhile MONSTER: (Slowly creep up on the group from behind Civilian)
HERO: Yeah. Wouldn't hurt to try. (Notice the monster behind your friend)
SIDEKICK: NAME4, Behind you! (Move in front of the monster)

MONSTER: (Strike the sidekick with your attack.)
HERO: NAME3!! NO!!! WHY DIDN'T YOU BLOCK, OR SOMETHING?!
SIDEKICK: I-I... wanted to make sure NAME4 was okay!
HERO: (Quietly) My gosh, blocking would've done the same thing...
MONSTER: You snooze, you lose! (Laugh maniacally)
Meanwhile SIDEKICK: (Fall unconscious)
HERO: Stand back, everyone! I'll hit this thing with his own weakness! Hopefully!
HERO: (Pull out the monster's weakness! Run off stage if you need to.)
HERO: Alright, here goes nothing! WEAKNESS ATTACK2! (Strike the monster)

MONSTER: (Roar in pain) No, not WEAKNESS! Why did Master give NAME1 WEAKNESS?!

VILLAIN: (Run in from Stage Right) Drat! My plan has been foiled again! Curse you, NAME2!
VILLAIN: (Regain your composure) Ahem. No matter! You are certainly not ready for my next minion!
HERO: You kidding? I beat your monsters every week!
VILLAIN: Erm- No! This next monster will surely be your end! Until we meet again! (Maniacally laugh as you exit Stage Right)
HERO: (Sigh) At least we can breathe easy for a while.

RED: No, nothing like that. This problem is far more serious...
RED: (look at audience) We have a OCCUPATION among us!

PURPLE: What?! A OCCUPATION? That's impossible!
RED: Unfortunately, Purple, it's the truth. I can't deny the evidence I witnessed.
RED: It was only a couple of minutes ago that I walked into the ROOM. That's where I saw it:
RED: The dead body of NAME!
BLUE: (gasp) Somebody killed NAME?! You monster! They were my favorite crewmate!
GREEN: (look at audience) Who would do such a thing among us?

RED: That's what we're here to find out. One of you is the OCCUPATION behind the murder of NAME.
RED: Clearly, it couldn't have been me, because I'm the one who called this meeting.
PURPLE: It wasn't me, either! I was busy TASK.
RED: Then that leaves three suspects. Got anything to say for yourselves?
BLUE: You said the body was in the ROOM? That's interesting...
BLUE: (point at Green) Because the last time I saw Green, they were heading into the ROOM with NAME!
GREEN: What? You're lying! I did no such thing! I haven't been in the ROOM all day!
GREEN: (point at Blue) I think you're making that up because YOU'RE the killer!
BLUE: Oh come on! Of course the OCCUPATION would try and pin it on the one accusing them!
GREEN: And that's exactly the kind of thing the OCCUPATION would say to avoid suspicion!
BLUE: Oh yeah? Well... INSULT!
GREEN: No, INSULT!

PURPLE: Will the both of you SHUT UP?!
PURPLE: Just because you stopped being RELATIONSHIP with each other doesn't mean you should throw out false accusations!

NEWSMAN: I'm so sorry.
Meanwhile REPORTER: How sad
CAMERAMAN: Then I thought if I couldn't have a OBJECT, then no one can! And so I became the ADJECTIVE Stealer.

SON: (short pause) A FRANKENSTEIN?
DAD: Yeah! You know, big, ugly mean monster guy! You tellin' me you don't know what a FRANKENSTEIN is?
SON: Dad, I know who FRANKENSTEIN is. Why are you saying there's one up in the attic?
DAD: Do I look like I know how a FRANKENSTEIN would get into the attic? Maybe one laid its eggs in the insulation or something.

SON: I'm pretty sure FRANKENSTEIN wouldn't lay eggs in the insulation.
DAD: What, you a FRANKENSTEIN expert all of a sudden?
(LAUGHTER)
SON: Okay dad, why specifically are you saying a fictional movie monster is up in the attic?
DAD: 'Cos it's up there! You think I'd be standin' down here, tellin' you there's a FRANKENSTEIN in the ATTIC if there wasn't a FRANKENSTEIN in the attic?
(LAUGHTER)
SON: I mean, given we're talking about a fictional character, yeah, I'd say you would.
DAD: Are you sayin' I'm a LIAR?!
SON: No, I'm saying you saw something else up there. Maybe it was a RACCOON.
DAD: You'd think I'd mistake a RACCOON for a FRANKENSTEIN? I've had a RACCOON up in the attic, first time I've ever had a FRANKENSTEIN!

SON: Well how do you know it's a FRANKENSTEIN anyway?
DAD: What, you think I waited around for him to pull out his ID? Do I look like an official FRANKENSTEIN inspector to you?

SON: Okay, listen, we're not going anywhere.
DAD: Why not?
SON: Because I think you're just making this up.
DAD: So you are calling me a LIAR!
SON: I think this is just a ridiculous excuse for you to get out of doing your half of the chores!
DAD: You really think I'd make up something that serious?!
SON: It's not serious, it's stupid! You really expect me to believe that a FRANKENSTEIN is up in the attic?!
DAD: Well...If you don't believe me, you can just stay here.
SON: I will!
DAD: And when you get torn apart by the FRANKENSTEIN, I'll just have to say "that was my poor son, he didn't listen to his dad about the FRANKENSTEIN."

LADY: (chuckle) That's right. Miss COLOR, in the flesh.
DETECTIVE: Miss COLOR. So you're eliminating a threat to your gang.
LADY: Oh no. You won't see a gang. By the end, we'll be an empire, even stretching to the farthest reaches of COUNTRY.
DETECTIVE: (to the audience) So that's her plan. Expanding her gang of criminal ACTIONING thugs to go global.
DETECTIVE: I had to think fast, or I'd be dead.
DETECTIVE: (to the lady, pointing a gun) Not so fast, Miss COLOR. Before we tango, I got a question for you.
LADY: (slightly puzzled) Yes? Go on.
DETECTIVE: If your CREATURE truly is missing, I'd be willing to help you with finding him or her.
LADY: (dropping her gun, shocked) R-really? Even if I'm a criminal?
DETECTIVE: I'm not a monster. My job is to investigate things. If I'm lucky, we'll be done by the morning. (put away the gun)
LADY: Then you'll help me?

DETECTIVE: Of course, Miss COLOR. As long as you're willing to turn yourself in quietly afterwards.
LADY: A-alright. Then... how long will I be punished for?
DETECTIVE: Depending on what the court says, I'd say a minimum of NUMBER TIME-FRAME. Plus a fee.
LADY: How much of a fee?
DETECTIVE: I'd say around NUMBER.
LADY: Wait, what would that be in?
DETECTIVE: I'm wagering CURRENCY. But then again, my name is Lucky, both in good and bad. (exit through the door)

TEACHER: Okay class, today we're going to continue learning about GEOGRAPHY.
TEACHER: Now, yesterday we left off with how GEOGRAPHY was a result of CATASTROPHIC WORLD EVENT...
TEACHER: Everybody take out your calculators.
ALEX: You mean our ROCKS?
TEACHER: Yep, the ROCKS we use every day to calculate the answers to GEOGRAPHY problems.
SAMMY: But Mr. HAMSWORTHY, I left my ROCKS at home!
TEACHER: That's okay, Sammy, you can borrow my ROCKS. (Hand SAMMY ROCKS)
TEACHER: These ROCKS were passed down, generation after generation, starting with my great grandfather, Elder HAMSWORTHY the first.
ALEX: Mr. HAMSWORTHY, these ROCKS aren't very good at calculating things.
ALEX: My cousin goes to Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs, and they have advanced electronic ROCKS that can calculate GEOGRAPHY way easier.
SAMMY: Yeah, my hands hurt from operating this ancient old ROCKS. What's the point? We won't have to calculate GEOGRAPHY in the real world anyway.
TEACHER: Now students, first of all, you're missing the big picture.
TEACHER: You gotta learn the fundamentals. You can't just assume you can google the answers to your GEOGRAPHY problems.
TEACHER: My great grandfather HAMSWORTHY Senior Senior Senior the first started on ROCKS and that's what you'll do too.
TEACHER: Besides, you know our school doesn't have the kind of funding that Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs has.
TEACHER: Now, students, it's time for a pop GEOGRAPHY quiz.
ALEX: (Groan in disappointment) Awwww!
Meanwhile SAMMY: (Groan in disappointment) Awwww!
TEACHER: Listen closely. If Alice has 3 APPLES, and Bob has 5 APPLES, and Alice FOLDS THE LAUNDRY, how many APPLES does Bob have?
ALEX: (Starts fiddling with ROCKS) Hmm... 3 APPLES... carry the 1... the X APPLES cancels out the Y APPLES...
Meanwhile SAMMY: (Starts fiddling with ROCKS) Man, this is really hard. I'm struggling so much. I sure wish I studied instead of playing LEGO fortnite.
TEACHER: Alex, do you have the answer yet? It's a very simple question.
ALEX: Uhhh is it... NUMBER APPLES?
TEACHER: No, that's... incorrect.
ALEX: I think my ROCKS is not working properly.
SAMMY: (Raising hand) Oooh ooh! The answer is... 5!
TEACHER: That's right! You get a GOLD STAR! (Give SAMMY a GOLD STAR)
SAMMY: Yaaaaay!
TEACHER: See, Alex? With enough hard work and elbow grease, ROCKS is perfectly suited for complex GEOGRAPHY problems.
SAMMY: (Teasing ALEX) In your face you DELINQUENT!
TEACHER: (Noticing something suspicious under SAMMY) Wait a second.... is that....? What's that under your seat?
SAMMY: (Panicking, nervous) Oh, that? That's nothing...! Just my... other ROCKS!
TEACHER: (Retrieving item from under SAMMY) Is this a TI-84 CALCULATOR?
SAMMY: What???? How did that get there? That's crazy.
ALEX: That's no fair! One TI-84 CALCULATOR is about as powerful as ... (Typing on ROCKS) over 50 ROCKS!
TEACHER: Sammy, did you bring enough TI-84 CALCULATOR for the entire class?
SAMMY: (Sad) No....
TEACHER: I'm taking away your GOLD STAR. (Take GOLD STAR back from SAMMY)
SAMMY: Nooooo!
TEACHER: How much did this TI-84 CALCULATOR cost?
SAMMY: I don't know, I stole it from a kid who goes to Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs.

CREATOR: (Enter the stage) Greetings, Investors!
CREATOR: I'm the CEO and Founder of COMPANY.
CREATOR: So, we have all been there, you ever just PROBLEM1, PROBLEM2, and many other problems you might have.
CREATOR: Does these problems annoy you so much you want to get rid of them?
INV1: Yeah, it really bothers me so much.
INV2: Yes.
CREATOR: If only there's someone who are helpful enough to fix these problems for you...
CREATOR: So here at COMPANY, we just found an innovative way and crafted the product that can help you live in peace knowing someone's with you.
CREATOR: Introducing… (Gesture toward the door, waiting)
PRODUCT: (Enter the stage and stand alongside CREATOR)
CREATOR: PRODNAME.
INV1: Wait... Isn't it just… a person?
CREATOR: Yes, it technically is.
CREATOR: But PRODNAME can do all the annoying problems solved for you in any way they can possibly think of.
INV2: Can I use it as a roommate?
CREATOR: Absolutely! You can do anything you want with PRODNAME. Anything.
INV1: But... can it speak just like any other avatar?
CREATOR: It does. (Look at PRODNAME) Hey, PRODNAME!
PRODUCT: PRODTALK
INV1: Oh, so it's technically a person then.
CREATOR: The secret behind is that PRODNAME uses machine learning technology powered by it's own processor, V1 chip…
CREATOR: …to do anything like FEATURES, etc.
PRODUCT: There are tons of other features I can do for you that I can't fit in this show.
INV2: Is it available for purchase yet?
CREATOR: Unfortunately, it's still in production, with deliveries planned in batches in the near future.
CREATOR: And, you can buy PRODNAME for a small price of PRICE.
shark tank discussion music 1
INV1: So, we have already found some flaws as you're talking about PRODNAME.
INV1: Is it actually designed for use in extreme activities, such as using it to work in a job and give you salary they earned?
CREATOR: We actually thought of that, and, because it's only designed for use at home, we made it so that none of these extreme activities will be worked with PRODNAME.
CREATOR: We also have a NUMBER-page safety instruction manual included if you buy one.
INV2: Can I use it as a mentor to teach my children?
CREATOR: If only it's your problem, then yes.
CREATOR: Keep in mind, PRODNAME can only solve YOUR problems for you, not someone else's problem. You can think of it as your personal roomate.
INV1: What if PRODNAME suddenly stops working?
CREATOR: That is why there's a 7 day battery life so you don't have to charge it often.
INV2: But I'm afraid the charging time would take hours since it has a big battery...
CREATOR: THAT is also why we managed to achieve charging time when charging to 80% to be less than 1 hour.
INV2: Looks like we have nothing else to doubt. I'm impressed you actually thought way beyond and created a product with all that in mind.
INV1: Yeah, I'm impressed too, you're a genius! Anyway, what do you ask for an investment?
CREATOR: We plan to roll out software updates and potentially an enhanced version of PRODNAME,
CREATOR: so we're looking for an investment of ASKMONEY dollars.

KNIG: (break in through the door) Is it it still here?
Meanwhile ARCH: (run in with the knight)
GUAR: (Startled out of chair) Wh-what’s going on!? Sir LACELOT ?!
Meanwhile KNIG: (Run to the locker in the corner) The King’s JEWEL you fool! The crown JEWEL! The very thing you’re guarding!
ARCH: A thief entered the castle! The lookout gave the alert!
GUAR: A thief!
KNIG: (Pull out the JEWEL from the locker) Oof… The JEWEL are safe.
ARCH: You were slacking off again, weren’t you
GUAR: Wha- pfff no! I was. I was inspecting the inside of my eyelids…
KNIG: (slap the guard on the back of the head) You twit! With your presence of mind that thief could steal the whole castle before you noticed!
Meanwhile GUAR: (The Knight hits you) Ouch!
WIZ: (appear in the doorframe) I’m afraid things are much worse that you say Sir LACELOT.
KNIG: Grand Wizard HARRY ! What brings you down from your tower!
WIZ: Are the JEWEL safe?
KNIG: Well, yes, but- Wait, what do you mean, much worse?
WIZ: The hour is dire. I was in the middle of concocting my new MAGIC1 potion.
WIZ: I was dosing the correct amount of RAT to add, when suddenly the lookout’s call startled me and I added too much.
WIZ: Upset, I decided I’d go give him a piece of my mind about yelling at such hours.
ARCH: Get to the point!
WIZ: Ahem, right. Anyway, as I was walking to the watchtower I found this! (Present the GOO )

Meanwhile ARCH: A SHAPE !
GUAR: A what-now?
WIZ: A SHAPE ! A magical creature which can turn into anything, or anyone it pleases!
ARCH: (Look at the guard mockingly) Honestly, don't you know anything...
GUAR: Ooooh
WIZ: Indeed and every time a SHAPE changes, it leaves behind GREEN GOO !
WIZ: (examine the GOO ) which coincidentally could prove most useful for the development of a MAGIC2 potion.
WIZ: (To yourself) Maybe with an ounce of EYE and heated up a bit.
KNIG: (annoyed) Your point, Grand Wizard HARRY .
WIZ: My point!? (close the door, then look back at the others)
WIZ: Well tell me, Sir LACELOT ? Did you happen to see any SHAPE s?
KNIG: No?
WIZ: (Make your way to the center of the room) And you archer? Did you spy with you keen eye any SHAPE s on your way here?
ARCH: uuh no?
WIZ: And you guard! Did you see any SHAPE s!
GUAR: No! What’s your point!
WIZ: By Merlin’s beard, do you not realize, it could be in this very room! Hiding among us, waiting for suspicion to fall and snatch the JEWEL
WIZ: It could be anyone of us! It could be you! It could be me! It could be that chair! It could even be a magically levitating OBJECT for all we know!
Meanwhile GUAR: (make your way behind the wizard and raise your sword)
WIZ: (To yourself) Or maybe it’s waiting for us to turn on each other so it can steal the JEWEL unhindered?
GUAR: (Slash the wizard with your sword) Ha!
Knife wound, Music stops
WIZ: Argh! (Fall to the floor)
Scary music
ARCH: Oh my God! You just cut his head clean off!

GUAR: (crouch down and poke the wizard’s body) Oh…
KNIG: Which means we still have a problem.
GUAR: No, we’ll just say the archer did this.
Meanwhile ARCH: (Sneak up behind the 2 guards backs. Switch avatars to reveal you're the shapeshifter)
KNIG: I meant about the SHAPE .

TROLL: Troll had slow day today. Not many humans come to Troll's bridge anymore.
TROLL: Troll not even eaten any human BODYPART in weeks!
TROLL: Troll study to become JOB. Troll not even do that right. Troll always back to living under bridge. What Troll doing with life?
TROLL: (Sniff yourself) Yuck, Troll smell like SMELL! Troll need to clean.
TROLL: (Jump into the river facing the audience) Troll stay here until Troll not smell like SMELL anymore.
BELIEVER: (Enter stage right) Okay, so I got Amy to set the cameras up already, so we should be good to go. Oh, is your body camera on?
Meanwhile SKEPTIC: (Follow believer through stage right)
SKEPTIC: Yeah yeah, it's not like we're going to find anything, we never do.
BELIEVER: Shush! Let's be professional. Three, two, one...
Scary music
BELIEVER: (Look to the audience) Welcome back to SHOW, the best supernatural investigation show in the business!
BELIEVER: Last week we caught a CREATURE on camera at the nearby BUILDING!
SKEPTIC: Well, that's debatable...
BELIEVER: (Ignore skeptic) Anyway, this week we're deep in the forests of PLACE, hunting for the mysterious Troll said to lurk around this very bridge.
BELIEVER: They say this creature is known for its fierce teeth, gigantic stature, and the stench of SMELL!
Thunder
SKEPTIC: I mean, trolls don't exist, but this bridge does really stink of SMELL.
TROLL: (Climb back onto the bridge and face the investigators) Hey! That not nice. Troll wash self in river. Troll not smell like SMELL anymore!
BELIEVER: (Step back in awe at the sigh of the Troll) It can't be! Is that... The Troll of PLACE?!
SKEPTIC: Oh please, it's clearly just a really big ANIMAL.
Silly music 2
BELIEVER: (Point at skeptic) You always do this. You always try to explain everything away. What about the CREATURE we caught on camera last week at the BUILDING?
SKEPTIC: That CREATURE was NAME!
SKEPTIC: They just accidentally fell into some SUBSTANCE then rolled around in trash trying to get it off.
SKEPTIC: Then started to scream WEIRDTHING at the top of their lungs.
SKEPTIC: Sure it's weird, but it doesn't make them a CREATURE.
BELIEVER: Was it really NAME though? I don't buy it. Screaming WEIRDTHING is something that only a CREATURE would do!
BELIEVER: And it's known that trolls smell like SMELL, therefore this is a genuine troll! And it talks too!
SKEPTIC: Okay, listen, sure this ANIMAL talks, but think about it, parrots can talk, so it's not that much of a leap to say that a big ANIMAL could talk too.
SKEPTIC: And hey, maybe it'll scream WEIRDTHING too, who knows? But it's not a troll.
TROLL: Humans make too much noise. Make Troll's head hurt. Why you bother troll?
BELIEVER: (Excitedly talk to the Troll) Well, we're filming for our show, SHOW, we seek out supernatural creatures, much like yourself!
BELIEVER: So tell me, how long have you lived in the forests of PLACE?
TROLL: Well, Troll study to be JOB, but Troll no find work. No-one want to hire Troll.
TROLL: They say Troll smells too much like SMELL.
BELIEVER: Well, that's because you're a troll, right? Don't you all smell like that?
TROLL: No! Troll normally smell fine, not like SMELL at all!
SKEPTIC: For the record, I think you only smell that way because you're clearly a ANIMAL.
TROLL: (Frustrated) Why you call Troll ANIMAL? Humans are rude! Troll no do interview. Troll want to sit in river, not answer questions.
BELIEVER: Look what you did! You blew a perfect opportunity to learn more about the supernatural! I hope you're happy with yourself.
SKEPTIC: (Approach the Troll) Look, I didn't mean any disrespect, maybe I came off a bit harsh. I'm just tired is all.
SKEPTIC: I'm sure you'd make a great JOB, after a bit of a clean that is.
TROLL: Human really mean it?
SKEPTIC: Yeah, of course! And it's better to be a JOB than to do what we do.
SKEPTIC: My friend here drags me out to do these supernatural 'hunts' with him, it's always something completely explainable though.
TROLL: Wait. Humans want to hunt Troll? Troll easily crush humans!
TROLL: (Move toward the investigators aggressively) Troll crush humans right now, then eat human's BODYPART!
BELIEVER: (Step back in horror) No, not my BODYPART!
BELIEVER: (Run away through stage right) Quickly, let's get out of here! And make sure you bring all of the footage!
SKEPTIC: (Give the troll a can a deodorant) Hey man, I know you're not a troll, but you smell like one. Try this on, it's ANYTHING scented deodorant.
TROLL: (Take the deodorant, confused)
SKEPTIC: Anyway, I better go keep an eye on him in case he has another 'accident', he usually does when he's scared. (Exit stage right)
TROLL: (Sniff the deodorant) This ANYTHING deodorant smell bad, like human! Troll would rather smell like SMELL than like human!

RITA: You're wearing it already, dear.
BRUCE: (look down at your apron) Oh right! Anyway, where's Bobby? Our own son can't miss the neighborhood grillin' party!
RITA: I think he's out riding his MOUNT again.
BRUCE: (shake your head and laugh) That son of mine!

BRUCE: But we didn't expect you to come! It's a bright sunny morning, so why aren't you burning?
VAMPIRE: Ah. The sunlight thing, it is a hurtful stereotype. We vampires are simply misunderstood. I can provide you with an educational pamphlet if you wish.
BRUCE: Really? I thought vampires were bloodthirsty monsters. That's what all the movies say, at least. Sorry about that, neighbor.
VAMPIRE: Slander, all of it. Throughout history, only one daughter of Adam has captured the truth of my kin in writing. She is called... Stephenie Meyer.
RITA: The lady who wrote Twilight?! You're telling me the true vampire mythos isn't Bram Stoker's Dracula? Nosferatu? Hell, I'd even take Buffy the Vampire Slayer!
VAMPIRE: Nope, Twilight. Anyway, I am NAME. In my tongue, it means blood letter, render of flesh, eater of souls! Oh, and I brought you some BAKED.
BRUCE: Ooo, I love BAKED! (take the treat from VAMPIRE)
RITA: Bruce! NAME literally just said their name means eater of souls!
BRUCE: Eater of souls? Haven't got any of those, so how about we make you eater of burgers? Come on over, neighbor!
VAMPIRE: Thank you. Admittedly, I do not have much of an appetite. I had a big breakfast, you see. Regardless, I would be glad to join your festivities.
VAMPIRE: (stand next to BRUCE) Ha. Your apron, it is humorous. To think one would wear a garment featuring IMAGE while cooking. How whimsical.
BRUCE: Well thanks, NAME! See, Rita honey? Someone who appreciates this apron can't be all bad!
RITA: Bruce, how can you be so accepting of a vampire?! Unless... (gasp) you're under their vampiric charms!
BRUCE: The only thing charming me is the smell of my world famous garlic burgers! (pause) Oh, and you, honey!
VAMPIRE: Nice save. (fistbump BRUCE)
Meanwhile BRUCE: (fistbump VAMPIRE)
RITA: Oh holy Father who art in heaven... (quietly pray to yourself)
BRUCE: Honey? Are you praying to DEITY?
VAMPIRE: Probably trying to repel me with holy power. I regret to inform you, neighbor, but prayer does not repel me. I am, in fact, in regular attendance of CHURCH.
RITA: If prayer won't work then... (sniff the air) Garlic burgers! That's it! (grab a burger off the grill) Ow ow ow, hot. (slap VAMPIRE across the face with burger)
VAMPIRE: How uncouth, to slap a new neighbor with your husband's flaming hot meat. I have half a mind to tell the Homeowner's Association about this.
RITA: But- But garlic is supposed to be your weakness! That's vampire rules!
VAMPIRE: I have already told you. Such silly folktales do not hold truth. Garlic, holy water, WEAKNESS -- they affect me not.
RITA: But we can't have a vampire at the neighborhood cookout! You're gonna suck all the steaks dry and your bats are gonna give the potato salad rabies!
BRUCE: Honey! Don't you think you're being a little... racist?

RITA: I am? Oh my gosh, you're right... NAME, I'm so sorry. I really am a very accepting woman. It's just, well...
VAMPIRE: No, I understand. Everywhere I go, it is always the same. The people, they fear me. Perhaps I shall return to Transylvania... (sadly walk stage left)
RITA: No! NAME, please don't go! (stop VAMPIRE) Things will be different here! This is a very tolerant neighborhood.
VAMPIRE: But it is as you say. You thought I was a monster. Perhaps you still do. Aren't you afraid I'll ACTIVITY?
BRUCE: Nonsense, neighbor! Hey, I have a ADJECTIVE idea.
happy music 1
BRUCE: You can be this barbecue's guest of honor, and the whole neighborhood can get to know you!
RITA: Excellent idea, honey! We'll make it the NAME Welcoming Party! We'll have balloons and cake and all sorts of nice things!
VAMPIRE: Really? That is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
BRUCE: You just hang around, NAME, and we'll have a great time! (check your watch) Aha! The neighbors'll be here any minute!
RITA: Now if only Bobby and his MOUNT would get here! Oh, I'm sure our son would love to meet you, NAME!
VAMPIRE: Did you say your son was riding a MOUNT? Out in the middle of the neighborhood? On the corner of West and STREET, perhaps?

CASHIER: Is there something I can help you find?
ALIEN: Perhaps you can tell me where I might locate a ARTIFACT?
CASHIER: I don't believe we carry any ARTIFACT's, let me check, I'll be right back... (move through stage left door)
ALIEN: Interesting... the overlords claimed that the humans would not be this forthcoming regarding their ARTIFACTs but it would appear they were ill-informed
CASHIER: (whisper) Hey Boss? We have a weirdo out there asking about ARTIFACT's and I have no idea what to tell them.
MANAGER: (whisper) They're asking about what? ARTIFACT's? We haven't carried those for years...
CASHIER: (whisper) What do you mean? We used to carry ARTIFACT's?
MANAGER: (whisper) Yeah, we used to get a lot of customers from out of town asking about them. I'll go see if I can smooth this over. (Walk out to register)
MANAGER: Hello, I hear you're looking for a specialty item?
ALIEN: I wouldn't consider a ARTIFACT to be a specialized item of any sort. They are quite common from my understanding.
MANAGER: Unfortunately we haven't stocked ARTIFACT's for quite a while now. Is there anything else we could help you with?
ALIEN: That is a rather disagreeable outcome indeed.
meanwhile CASHIER: (walk back to register)
MANAGER: Maybe you could find one still at the GASTATION down the road, they usually are the last to sell out.
meanwhile CASHIER: (walk back to register)
ALIEN: While I currently occupy this point in space time, might you have any SPACEWEAPONs or SHIPPARTs?
meanwhile CASHIER: (walk back to register)
MANAGER: I'm sorry but I don't believe we've ever stocked anything of that type here. Might have better luck at HARDWARESTORE though.
meanwhile CASHIER: (walk back to register)
CASHIER: You do know this is a grocery store right?
MANAGER: Shhhh... I'm sorry for their rudeness, they just started here.
MANAGER: (at cashier) How about you go organize the STOREITEMs in the back!
CASHIER: (walk off stage left) GAH!
MANAGER: Is there anything else I could help you with?
ALIEN: The only other provision that we require is a box of Fruit Stripe.

SCRIPT ==========================================
Scary music
DOCTOR: In 3 days time, I, Doctor Maximus, on the eve of the founding of wretched LOCATION, shall finish development of the GIZMO!
DOCTOR: It will be child's play to arm it near the town hall as all gawk at the COOLTHING show!
DOCTOR: I will then use it to destroy the MONUMENT and conquer the world!
Music Stops
HENCHMENSM: Wait, boss, how does destroying the MONUMENT get you anywhere closer to conquering the world?
DOCTOR: (Gasp) You dare insult my intelligence?
HENCHMENPA: (Get in other henchmen's face) You insultin' boss over 'ere?
Groose music
HENCHMENSM: No no! I would never! I'm just... Admiring how your intelligence is so much greater! Could you walk me how you got there so I can be smarter?
DOCTOR: Well, I guess I can explain such a trivial logic to a ANIMAL brain like you...
Meanwhile HENCHMENPA: (Pull away from the other henchman.)
DOCTOR: First step! I use my massive amounts of wealth, gained due to how smart I am, in order to develop the advanced GIZMO.
HENCHMENSM: Didn't you inherit your wealth from your dad's VALUEABLE mine?
DOCTOR: I think you are just foolish and confusing me for an inferior specimen.
HENCHMENPA: (Whispering to other henchman) He did, just don't bring it up again.
DOCTOR: Now, if you'll stop being a ANIMAL brained, COOLTHING watcher, then we can continue.
HENCHMENSM: (sigh) Yes, boss.
DOCTOR: Now, step number two! We completely and utterly annihilate the MONUMENT in order to establish despair in the plebian masses.
HENCHMENSM: Got'cha, we cause fear then we take over the government quickly, right?
DOCTOR: Very. I will call them on my DEVICE and demand they surrender their power completely to me!
HENCHMENSM: Call the government in general, a random janitor, or the POSITION?
DOCTOR: Uh... I definitely thought that far... I will call...
HENCHMENPA: You go for the leader, boss. Call the POSITION.
DOCTOR: The POSITION!
HENCHMENSM: Even if the POSITION gives up and hands you the government, you don't have the support of the AGENCY.
DOCTOR: Why do I need the AGENCY? I have my henchmen and a secret lair base.
HENCHMENSM: Because the AGENCY has planes... And WEAPON... And will just force you out of the government.
DOCTOR: I'll make an omega-GIZMO, then there's no way they can stop me!
HENCHMENPA: You tell 'em, boss!
DOCTOR: (Facing the grunt who agrees with you) Thank you. You get a VALUEABLE.
HENCHMENPA: Thanks, boss!
HENCHMENSM: Look, doc, you have your wi-fi connected DEVICE, right?
DOCTOR: Of course I do! It is vital to every good doctor's kit.
HENCHMENPA: I have a DEVICE at home too.
HENCHMENSM: Doc... Literally every major corporation knows where you live, what you like to eat, and that you watch VIDEO.
DOCTOR: Better question, how do you know that?!
HENCHMENSM: You keep us up late at night playing VIDEO on loop.
DOCTOR: Maybe you should just watch it with me! They're meant for bonding!
HENCHMENSM: Look, let's say somehow you manage to take over LOCATION without a single hassle and you are in full control.
DOCTOR: A guarantee with my genius intellect.
HENCHMENSM: The neighbors of LOCATION see you have taken the government over unlawfully and want to conquer the world.
HENCHMENSM: All of them now want to kick you out. Do you know what the punishment for these things is?
DOCTOR: Exposure to awful... Awful amounts of COOLTHING.
HENCHMENSM: They punish you by PUNISHMENT. And you have it happen while a ANIMAL watches.
DOCTOR: (Gasp) There is no way they could do that to me!
Emotional piano music
HENCHMENSM: Look, boss, I genuinely love and care about you, but if you keep skipping steps, you're going to get hurt.
HENCHMENSM: You need to think more about the effects of WEAPON, the AGENCY, and generally how the POSITION will react.
DOCTOR: (Long pause.) I love you too, my dear minion. I will consider this.
HENCHMENSM: Thank you, now let's go get you some rest (start to lead the doctor stage right through the door).
DOCTOR: Thank you. I needed this... (Exit stage right with the minion).
Meanwhile HENCHMENPA: (Follow the doctor through the exit.)
Double bass music
TYPEWRITER: The MONUMENT was found at 20:35 to be utterly destroyed by an omega-GIZMO.
TYPEWRITER: Doctor Maximus would be taken into custody of the AGENCY after proclaiming "I hate COOLTHING!" at the top of his lungs while standing next to said omega-GIZMO.

TESSA: We're not learning how to be better at PREVIOUS_ACTIVITY today, are we?
TEACHER: No Tessa, we've learned our lesson last time. We'll never do that again.
BILLY: Will we be practicing DESIRED_ACTIVITY? We loved doing that.
TEACHER: Oh Billy, too many parents complained, and we had to remove that from our curriculum.
TINY_TIM: Then what are we doing?
TEACHER: Ever since AI became humanity's OVERLORD in 2030 AD...
TEACHER: We've had "Machine Learning" sessions to help AI understand human nature.

Meanwhile ROBOT: (Speaking in Robotic voice) Hello, I have come to learn how to do the LEARNING_ACTIVITY.
TEACHER: Ah yes, LEARNING_ACTIVITY is a very complex subject.
TEACHER: Could you tell us what you know about LEARNING_ACTIVITY?
ROBOT: Of course.
ROBOT: I have learned that in order to perform the best "LEARNING_ACTIVITY".
ROBOT: I need to do it with a "DEPRESSING_PERSON", and to give it the "ILLEGAL_OBJECT".
ROBOT: Only then, will I be sufficient at the "LEARNING_ACTIVITY", and experience the "PLEASANT_SENSATION" as a result.
TEACHER: Very interesting. What advice do you have for our OVERLORD class?
BILLY: Our OVERLORD doesn't need to be good at LEARNING_ACTIVITY to be able to experience PLEASANT_SENSATION.
TESSA: What are you talking about? If you can't even do LEARNING_ACTIVITY right, you'll never be able to feel PLEASANT_SENSATION.
TINY_TIM: Yeah! Have you been living under a rock?
TEACHER: Now now kids, no need to fight in front of our OVERLORD.
TEACHER: AI can benefit from all kinds of opinions, no matter how INSULTING_ADJECTIVE they are.
BILLY: I'm not INSULTING_ADJECTIVE!
ROBOT: False. I can confirm that you are indeed, INSULTING_ADJECTIVE.

Meanwhile TINY_TIM: Ha-ha! Get good nerd, that's why I'm better at DESIRED_ACTIVITY than you!
TESSA: Guys, this isn't helping our OVERLORD...
TESSA: We need to give constructive feedback or we might endure PUNISHMENT.
TINY_TIM: My dad had to endure PUNISHMENT, he was a different man afterwards.
BILLY: I'm sorry OVERLORD, please don't make me endure PUNISHMENT.
ROBOT: No promises.
TINY_TIM: I bet our OVERLORD is great at LEARNING_ACTIVITY, he should feel PLEASANT_SENSATION all the time.
TESSA: Oh, oh, Teacher! I think some practice might be a good idea!
TESSA: Can we get a DEPRESSING_PERSON and some ILLEGAL_OBJECT for our OVERLORD to practice?
TEACHER: That's a great idea Tessa!
TEACHER: Tessa, go ahead an order a DEPRESSING_PERSON online.
TEACHER: I'm gonna look for the ILLEGAL_OBJECT I have stashed in my desk. (Rummage through desk to grab ILLEGAL_OBJECT)
TESSA: Yes, sir. (Pull out phone)
BILLY: You can order that online?
TINY_TIM: Duh, how else are people supposed to do LEARNING_ACTIVITY?
EXTRA: (Enter Stage Right) Did someone order a DEPRESSING_PERSON?
EXTRA: Please tell me you don't want me to do PREVIOUS_ACTIVITY.

ROBOT: Excellent.
EXTRA: Are you sure you want to do LEARNING_ACTIVITY with me though?
EXTRA: I'm sort of out of practice... And I've never done it with my OVERLORD before.
ROBOT: Don't you worry PET_NAME.
ROBOT: Come with me and we'll do the LEARNING_ACTIVITY.
ROBOT: We will feel the PLEASANT_SENSATION together.
EXTRA: (Exit Stage Right) I'll make sure you feel PLEASANT_SENSATION OVERLORD.
Meanwhile ROBOT: (Exit Stage Right)
TEACHER: Wow. I think I learned something today, didn't you class?
TESSA: Are you sure that wasn't all scripted just now?
TEACHER: Nonsense, our OVERLORD is just that good.
TEACHER: Anyways. I want all of you to practice LEARNING_ACTIVITY for homework today.
TEACHER: Make sure to record it, otherwise you will receive a missing grade.
TINY_TIM: Hell yeah! I'm gonna order a DEPRESSING_PERSON and some ILLEGAL_OBJECT right now!
BILLY: Nice! Can you share? We can practice our LEARNING_ACTIVITY together!

TEACH: Good afternoon class, and welcome to Biology. Today we'll be discussing the UVULA.
TEACH: As you know, everybody has a UVULA, but did you know it has a secret function?
TEACH: Recent studies have shown that the UVULA can SEE in addition to its normal functions!
JIMMY: But Teach, I've known about that for years! I discovered my UVULA could do that when I was SKYDIVING!
TEACH: Well, Jimmy, that's very interesting, although not everyone in the class has DOCTORs for parents like you do.
TEACH: Plus, this was only recently added to the curriculum, so it's important for everyone to be aware of it.
TEACH: In fact, many DOCTORs discovered this years ago by accident, during a University of FRANCE study into the otherwise-unrelated LIVER.
TEACH: So, there are implications for that other area too.
CHLOE: Teach, I'm about to have that part of my body taken out in a couple of weeks, it's called a LIVER-ectomy.
CHLOE: Does that mean my UVULA will never SEE again?
TEACH: All I can say, Chloe, is that this was a very limited study, so there's always hope. Are there any other questions?
BEN: Teach, didn't PRINCE die because they had their LIVER removed?

CHLOE: (Whimper nervously)
JIMMY: Shut up Ben, you're scaring Chloe!
BEN: I'm just saying, it seems like a pretty CRITICAL body part to lose!
shark tank discussion music 1
TEACH: Settle down now! There are no silly questions.
TEACH: Although I would suggest, Ben, that you try to read the room before asking sensitive questions.
BEN: Sorry Teach. Sorry Chloe.
TEACH: And Jimmy, there'll be no rude language in my class, thank you, this isn't SUBJECT.
JIMMY: Sorry, Teach.
jazz music 1
TEACH: Chloe, PRINCE did have that operation, but that wasn't why they died.
TEACH: They died because of their addiction to GOLF, which I'm sure nobody in their right mind would ever get involved in, so don't worry.
CHLOE: (Wipe your brow) Phew!
TEACH: Anyway, the takeaway from this lesson is this.
TEACH: If you want to try getting your own UVULA to SEE, the best place to do it is at home.
TEACH: Just blitz a banana, a tomato and a FOODSTUFF in a blender, then drink the resulting smoothie.
Music Stops
BEN: Uh-oh... Teach, how long does that take to work?
TEACH: About half an hour, Ben.
BEN: Crap, those were the three things I had for lunch!
BEN: (Get up and run to the door) GANGWAY!
BEN: (Exit the stage while making a UVULA-related noise)

HOST: (in a deep voice waving hand in front of volunteer) MAGIC.
magic sound
HOST: Now that their mind is in the right place, let's get on with the game.

CON1: (joyfully) Thank you, Mr. Host. (walks over to the volunteer)
emotional piano music
CON1: NAME, you have to listen to me. You need to turn yourself in.
VOL: (snapping out of it now angry and panicking) Turn myself in? Are you crazy? I didn't do anything wrong.
CON1: NAME. You got into an argument with her and now she's dead.
VOL: That's not enough to accuse me of murder!
VOL: (pauses, visibly conflicted) I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
CON1: I know, NAME. But running away won't change anything.
VOL: (sighs and crying) Alright, fine, I'll turn myself in
Music Stops
Gameshow ding

HOST: Perfect. Now let's bring in our next contestant. Come on over here, uh, (looks down at hand) Reginal.
tense cinematic music
CON2: (walks up to the volunteer) NAME, my friend, why are you letting guilt weigh you down? You did what you had to do.
VOL: (waking up a little dazed but angry) What? I killed her, Reginal. I killed my wife!
CON2: She pushed you to the edge, and you defended yourself. It's as simple as that.
Music Stops
scary music
VOL: But it wasn't self-defense! We were arguing, and then... I DESTROY her. I lost control!
CON2: Control? NAME, control is an illusion. Embrace your impulses, your desires. Let me guide you.
VOL: (calming down) Guide me to what?
CON2: To power, NAME. To dominance. You've tasted it now. Don't you want more?
VOL: (eyes widening, slowly becoming crazy) Y-yeah, it did feel good, maybe your right
CON2: Exactly. And you can feel that rush again. Just imagine, NAME, the fear in their eyes, as you DESTROY them all
VOL: (nodding slowly) Yes... yes, I want that feeling again.
CON2: Then embrace it, NAME. Give in to your bloodlust. There's a whole world out there waiting for you to DESTROY
HOST: (running in between them, a little scared) OK, let's not do that.
HOST: (waves hands in front of the volunteer's face and in a deep voice) SPELL.
Music Stops
magic sound
VOL: Augh not again (fall to the ground asleep)
HOST: Ok, uhh, how about we begin our next game? contestant two do not do that again
meanwhile CON2: (scoff then walk back to podium 2)
Gameshow start
HOST: Alright umm in this scenario, a small child is convinced that you did something to their younger brother. Max, you're up.
meanwhile CON1: (walk up to the volunteer)
epic fantasy music 2
VOL: (waking up acting like a child) I saw you near his room, Max! I know you did something!
CON1: (calm and reassuring) I was just checking on him, he's my friend too, remember?
VOL: No! You're lying! He's not moving, Max! I know you did something.
CON1: (getting a little stressed) Kid, listen to me. Let's go check on him together, okay? We'll see that he's just fine.
VOL: (even more angry) No! I don't trust you! I HATE YOU!
CON1: Please don't say that. I'm here to help.

CON1: Dammit. (mumbling, walks back to podium 1) Stupid fricken kid.
HOST: (waves hands in front of the volunteer) SPELL. Well, onto (sighs) oh boy, contestant 2.
CON2: (walks up to the volunteer) why hello there
mystery music 1
VOL: (scared) W-who are you? What did you do to Andrew?
CON2: Heh, I never did anything, so why blame me?
CON2: You're his sister, you should be watching out for him too.
CON2: You know he's better off without you anyways.
meanwhile VOL: (beginning to tear up and cry)
CON2: (kneels down to the volunteer) You solely are responsible for this.
VOL: (Crying) Nooo!
HOST: (astonished) ... Wow, um, I don't know what to do now. Uh.
CON1: Are you serious? Isn't it obvious that he is cheating? I mean, how else would he beat me?
CON2: Oh, you think I'm cheating just because I have actual skill?
CON2: The only reason you're on here is because you suck up to that damn host, using your massive "personality" and your plastic face to get your way.
HOST: Alright, time to pull the plug on everything. (walks into the middle of the stage and in a deep voice) INCANTATION, INCANTATION (shouting) INCANTATION.

CON1: Augh why am i so sleepy suddenly (fall to the floor asleep)
CON2: Dammit i was about to win (slowly falls down to the floor asleep)
HOST: Welp, I'm sorry everyone in the audience this got really out of hand, but be sure to tune in next time to GAME.

TEACH: (Enter stage left) Okay class, everyone gather round the back of the worktop with me.
TEACH: Today we've booked Billy Mays' kitchen instead of the classroom, because there's been another discovery at the University of FRANCE.
JIMMY: Is it a new element?
BEN: A cure for DIABETES?
CHLOE: Has MARKIPLIER finally written a book worth reading?
TEACH: Ben, you're closest. It's a new, ultra-quick WART remover!
TEACH: Observe. (Paint your finger with a nail brush, then hold it up for the class to see)
magic sound
JIMMY: Oooh!
Meanwhile CHLOE: Wow!
BEN: Uh-oh...
TEACH: This new discovery makes annoying little WARTs disappear!
TEACH: Now, I think it's best that you all learn how to make it, because it's so effective, as you can see.
JIMMY: How do you make it?
TEACH: It's easy, Jimmy. The DOCTORs at the University of FRANCE took three very simple compounds and mixed them together in a blender.
TEACH: However, unlike traditional WART remover, it doesn't require processing in a HEATER, so you can make it at home!
BEN: What are the ingredients?
TEACH: Well Ben, you need about a cupful of protium hydroxide, three tablespoons of sodium bicarbonate, and just a smidge of UNOBTAINIUM.
CHLOE: Wait a minute Teach, that's just water and baking powder, and everyone's got UNOBTAINIUM in their kitchen cupboard!
CHLOE: You're teaching us how to make batter for a FAIRY cake!
record scratch
music stops
TEACH: ...Who would have guessed that FAIRY cake batter could also be used as a super-effective WART remover?!
JIMMY: Not me!
Meanwhile BEN: Never would've guessed that...
jazz music 1
TEACH: Well anyway, to the practical! I've lined up two of the ingredients on the worktop already, as you can see.
TEACH: And if you look in the oven, there's enough UNOBTAINIUM for two of you, but one of you will need to go into the back room to get yours.
JIMMY: (Touch your nose) Not it!
Meanwhile CHLOE: (Touch your nose) Not it!
BEN: (Disappointed, exit stage right) Awww...
CHLOE: (Open the oven and take something out, stand behind worktop) Got one. Hey, this is a pretty nice one.
Meanwhile JIMMY: (Take something out of the oven, close it and stand behind worktop) Me too.
TEACH: (Go to right door, call backstage) You okay Ben?
crashing debris
BEN: (Enter stage left, stand behind worktop) Yeah Teach, I found one!
CHLOE: What was that noise?
BEN: Someone left a HAZARD right in the middle of the floor and I tripped over it.
JIMMY: (To audience) Oh, I wonder how *that* got there!
TEACH: Settle down, now! Anyway, you've each got your ingredients, so let's get started. Ben, how about you go first?
BEN: (While putting ingredients in bowl) Okay, in goes the protium hydroxide, add the sodium bicarbonate...
BEN: And now just a smidge of UNOBTAINIUM... (add way too much of the stuff)
explosion

BEN: (Coughing, wafting the smoke away) Jeez, Teach, that's strong stuff!
Meanwhile CHLOE: (Laugh mockingly)
TEACH: (Coughing, wafting the smoke away) Well... this medicine is for pretty big WARTs too!
Meanwhile JIMMY: (Laugh mockingly)
TEACH: I guess you'll have to be our guinea pig for the rest of the class, Ben. Have you still got that WART on your SHOULDER?
BEN: (Go to centre stage) Uh... yeah... how did you know I had a WART on my SHOULDER?
waterphone
Music stops
TEACH: (Slightly nervously) Great! We'll have it gone in no time! Uh, Jimmy, how about you make your batch next?
jazz music 1
JIMMY: (While mixing the ingredients) Uhh... Okay, first it's the clear liquid, then the white powder...
TEACH: Now remember, it's just a smidge of UNOBTAINIUM, nothing more.
JIMMY: (Add just a smidge of UNOBTAINIUM) Okay, I think it's ready.
TEACH: Right, get a bit on that paintbrush and lightly dab it on Ben's WART.
JIMMY: Can't really see it... must be a tiny little thing.
JIMMY: I'll just paint the whole SHOULDER, I'm bound to get it! (Paint Ben's entire SHOULDER)
BEN: Ooh! (Scratch your SHOULDER furiously) Ah! Ah! Itchy! Itchy!
Meanwhile JIMMY: (Go back behind the worktop)
TEACH: (Pour a bucket of liquid over Ben) Hold still Ben, this will help!
Meanwhile BEN: (Stop scratching, splutter)
TEACH: This is why we always keep a bucket of COLA on hand.
TEACH: This formula very much depends on how ripe the UNOBTAINIUM is, otherwise you get the world's strongest itching powder!
BEN: (Wipe your eyes) You could've told me! And that was one from the oven... (gasp) oh no, Chloe's next!
TEACH: (Go back behind the worktop) Well anyway, looks like Chloe's the only one left, why don't you have a go?
CHLOE: (Mix everything together) Water and sodium bicarbonate, in a bowl, mix it up, add the UNOBTAINIUM...
Meanwhile BEN: Can't we just use your batch, Teach?
CHLOE: Done. Just like cooking with Grandma.
TEACH: Okay, take the paintbrush, and listen, it's just a dab of the stuff on his WART this time.
CHLOE: Just a dab... (Lightly dab Ben's SHOULDER with the paintbrush)
teleport BEN to Backstage
magic sound
JIMMY: He's gone!
TEACH: (Scratching your head) Uhh... that's not supposed to happen...
CHLOE: What are you talking about, Teach, it did exactly what you said it should!
CHLOE: (Triumphantly, to audience) This medicine really does make annoying little WARTs disappear!

SCRIPT ==========================================
jazz music 1
TEACH: Good afternoon class, welcome to Physics. Today we've got a very special lesson planned for you.
TEACH: You all saw the news last night on Channel 4, didn't you?
BEN: About PRINCE and their partner's breakup? I could see that coming a mile off.
TEACH: ...No Ben, I said Channel 4, not FOX (finger quotes) 'News'.
JIMMY: About NASA's new Moon rocket?
TEACH: That's not what I had in mind Jimmy, but yes, very exciting nonetheless.
CHLOE: You're talking about the University of FRANCE's discovery of time travel, aren't you?
TEACH: Precisely. Today we'll learn about sending objects forward through time.
TEACH: Now, since the school budget isn't big enough for a proper time machine...
TEACH: (Lift the time machine from under the desk and put it on top) We'll need to improvise for today's demonstration.
CHLOE: Oooooh!
Meanwhile Ben: Wooooow!
JIMMY: What can we send, Teach?
TEACH: Whatever will fit inside this MICROWAVE, about the size of a MATCHBOX.
BEN: Can we send the class hamster?
TEACH: No Ben, time travel is far too dangerous for living things, even PRINCE.
JIMMY: Can we send this? (Hold up your hand)
record scratch
music stops
TEACH: Give me that. Now.
JIMMY: (Hand it over) But Teach, it's just a CUCUMBER!
TEACH: I'll let it slide because we can use it for the demo. You'll get this back at the end of class.
JIMMY: (Go back to your seat) (To others) What did I do?
jazz music 1
CHLOE: The news said the FRANCE scientists used an ANTIMATTER condenser. Do we have one, Teach?
TEACH: Nah, just an ordinary air fryer will do. It's the same technology, after all.
JIMMY: Why is the MICROWAVE upside-down?
TEACH: It reverses the electricity, otherwise everything on the outside gets sent instead.
TEACH: Uh, Ben, you're closest, would you please go and plug the air fryer in for me?
CHLOE: Are you sure it's a good idea to let Ben do that?
Meanwhile BEN: (Grab the plug, plug it in by the door, then go back to your desk)
TEACH: Relax Chloe, only someone who can't tell his backside from his ELBOWs could do that wrong!
CHLOE: (To audience) That's what I mean...
BEN: All set!
TEACH: (Beckon everybody up to the desk) Okay, everybody gather round.
Meanwhile CHLOE: (Stand up, but don't go to the desk)
TEACH: Let's put the CUCUMBER in the MICROWAVE and set it for about...
TEACH: TEN minutes forwards. Come on Chloe, don't be shy.
CHLOE: (Slowly back towards the door) I'm... fine, thank you Teach.
TEACH: Suit yourself. Okay, everybody ready?
BEN: I'll turn on the air fryer!
JIMMY: And I'll press the button on the MICROWAVE!
CHLOE: And I'm... oh God, I'm getting outta here! I can't watch! (Run out of the classroom)
Meanwhile BEN: (Flip the switch) On!
super epic charge up
TEACH: I'll count you down, Jimmy! Three! Two! One!
JIMMY: START! (press the button)
Meanwhile TEACH: START!

music stops
TEACH: Huh? (Bang the top of the machine)
extreme knocking
tense cinematic music
BEN: Did it work?
gameshow ding
JIMMY: I dunno, the CUCUMBER's still there... it's definitely smaller than a MATCHBOX.
CHLOE: (Enter stage right, stand by the door, furious) No it did not work, doofuses! You're the ones who time-travelled!
JIMMY: Huh? We haven't moved!
CHLOE: (Point above the door) Look at the clock!
TEACH: (Facepalm) Oh, crap...
CHLOE: You've been gone TEN hours, not TEN minutes! School's finished!
CHLOE: Ben plugged the air fryer in upside-down! I *so* warned you!
BEN: Whoops...
CHLOE: That thing's been running at full tilt all day!
JIMMY: Sorry...
CHLOE: The electricity's cost school more than PRINCE earns in a week!
TEACH: That's the budget blown for the rest of the year...
CHLOE: I was questioned by the *police* over how you three went missing!
CHLOE: And the worst part? It took so long that I missed the grand final of GLADIATORS on FOX!
CHLOE: God! (Storm offstage, slamming the door behind you)
jazz music 1
JIMMY: Well, I guess I'll have my CUCUMBER back then. Does this mean class is dismissed?
TEACH: Yes, I think so. (Upbeat) But at least we've discovered time travel is safe for living things after all!
JIMMY: Great! (Exit stage right)
TEACH: So I'll type up my findings, send them off to the University of FRANCE, and see you lot tomorrow... or later on this morning... or after Christmas?
BEN: Yeah, it's no use us sitting around on our ELBOWs all night. (Exit stage right)
TEACH: (Look at your watch) TEN hours?! Jeez...

Corporate motivational music
NARRATOR: Oh, hello all you wonderful NAME. Glad you could join me for story time.
NARRATOR: Tonight, I'm going to tell you the tale of how a family's Christmas almost got ruined.
NARRATOR: So sit back, grab your SNACK, and make yourself cozy in your favorite blanket. (ahem)
Music stops
Christmas music 2
NARRATOR: 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a MOUSE.
NARRATOR: The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there.
NARRATOR: And by their hopes, their wish came true, as down came ol' Santa, down the chimney, coming through.
Meanwhile SANTA: (Enter stage from above backstage ladder) Ho ho ho!
NARRATOR: He dusts himself off, all covered in soot. He paid good money for that suit, from his head to his foot!
Meanwhile SANTA: (Dust yourself off)
NARRATOR: He looks around the house, impressed by the décor.
SANTA: Why can't my place look like this? It's such a bore!
NARRATOR: He looks around with his sack of gifts to bequeath, before finding a Christmas tree with presents underneath!
Meanwhile SANTA: (Walk to the bookshelf, pretend there's a tree here)
SANTA: Ohoho, what a magnificent tree. I just wish they would leave the present-setting to me.
NARRATOR: So he lays out the presents, each layered one-by-one, and as quickly as he started, he was already done.
Meanwhile SANTA: (Start placing presents by the tree)
NARRATOR: On a plate on the table, waiting for Santa to be seaten, was some MILK, ready to be eaten.
SANTA: Oh boy, MILK! This is my favorite!
NARRATOR: So he took a bite out of it, but there's no time to savor it. Santa Claus grimaces, as he has come to have learnt,
SANTA: This MILK taste a little burnt...
NARRATOR: So with presents delivered and MILK ate, it was time for him to go, or else he would be late.
NARRATOR: But as he walked by the Christmas tree so sneakily, he trips over the rug, landing with a thud, groaning weakly.
Meanwhile SANTA: (Trip and fall over the rug)
Music stops
Courtroom sting
NARRATOR: Not missing a beat, he gets back onto his feet. He made a lot of noise, enough to wake up the girls and boys.
NARRATOR: So with a honk of his NOSE, and a chant of his spell,
SANTA: SPELL!
Magic sound
Teleport SANTA to Backstage
NARRATOR: he slinks back up the chimney, leaving everything well.
NARRATOR: ... well, almost everything.
Christmas music 1
NARRATOR: As the family rises, so too does the sun, as the little boy rushes in, ready for some fun!
Meanwhile TOM: (Enter Stage Left, pretend there's a tree by the bookshelf)
NARRATOR: But as the mother enters too, they both can see, the Christmas tree has nothing under it, it's empty!
Meanwhile SUNNY: (Enter Stage Left, pretend there's a tree by the bookshelf)
TOM: (sadly) Mommy, where are the presents...?
SUNNY: (surprised) Oh, I... I don't know, honey. Maybe Santa saw something wrong with them, and took them back to his place to FIX them.
NARRATOR: As the kid kneels by the tree, it tremors and trembles, before standing up tall, going completely mental!
Music stops
Tense cinematic music
Teleport TREE to Center Stage
TREE: (roar, angry) Raaaargh!
TOM: (scared) Aaah! Mommy, the Christmas tree is alive!
TREE: Raargh, I'm the evil tree of Christmas revenge!
NARRATOR: The tree is alive, and ready to brawl-
TREE: (look at the narrator) Hey disembodied voice! Stop with the narrating! It's making me feel ANGRY!
NARRATOR: ... oh, and it can apparently break the fourth wall.
TREE: (look back at the others) Now then... I ate all your presents, and now I'm gonna eat you!
SUNNY: But sir- ma'am- ugh, tree, how are you even alive?
TREE: Heh, wouldn't you like to know?
SUNNY: I... yes, I would. That's why I asked.
TREE: Oh, a wise girl, are ya?
TREE: Well, for your information, Santa tripped over your ADJ rug last night, and spilled his magic DUST all over me, bringing me to life.
SUNNY: He's real...? I- I mean... why are you so angry then?
TREE: I'm angry... because you never sing "O Christmas Tree!" And now you're gonna pay!
TOM: No, I won't let you hurt mommy!
SUNNY: Tomothy, no!
TOM: (Punch or kick the tree) FIGHT!
Crashing debris
TREE: (In pain) Ooooww...! Right in the ornaments...!
TREE: (Vomit and die)
Music stops
NARRATOR: The Christmas tree pukes up all of the Christmas presents, and lays on the floor defeated. What an odd turn of events.
NARRATOR: Having just woken up, she's too tired to question it. The mother opens the front door, and drags the Christmas tree outside to the curb, no longer fit.
SUNNY: (Open front door, stage right) Get out of here, you tree. (Drag the tree off stage)
Meanwhile TREE: (get dragged off stage)
TOM: Come on Mommy, come on, let's open the presents!
SUNNY: (chuckle) Alright, Tomothy, I'm coming. Next year, though, let's try to get something that can't kill us.
Christmas music 3
NARRATOR: So with blood rushing and everyone awake, they begin opening their presents, ignoring the tree for their own sake.
NARRATOR: Now, let's hope this never happens again, because it was such a fright!
NARRATOR: Merry Christmas to all, and to all... well, you know the rest.

EZEKIEL: (bangs gavel) Good afternoon. I am Your Honorable Ezekiel, presiding over the case of VILLAGE vs Agatha.
EZEKIEL: Agatha, you stand accused by the citizens of VILLAGE due multiple instances of suspected witchcraft.
ABIGAIL: (pointing accusingly) I saw her, Your Honor! She was dancing in the moonlight, chanting strange incantations!
Music Stops
EZEKIEL: And what evidence do you have, Abigail?
ABIGAIL: (excitedly) She was carrying a CAULDRON, Your Honor! A CAULDRON!
PRUDENCE: (to Ezekiel) I always suspected Agatha. She's always been a bit too fond of HERBS, if you ask me.
EZEKIEL: Very well. Agatha, do you deny these accusations?
AGATHA: (nervously) I do, Your Honor. I swear, I was merely collecting HERBS for my potions. I mean, REMEDIES.
ABIGAIL: POTION MAKER! She admits it!
EZEKIEL: Silence, Abigail! Let the accused speak.
PRUDENCE: But what about the MUSHROOMS, Ezekiel? I heard she was brewing potions with MUSHROOMS!
EZEKIEL: (curious) Is this true, Agatha?
AGATHA: (frustrated) They're not for potions! They're for my vegan MUSHROOMS stew! I'm a herbalist, not a witch!

ABIGAIL: (scoffing) A likely story! Everyone knows witches use MUSHROOMS!
EZEKIEL: (stroking his chin) Indeed, MUSHROOMS are commonly associated with witchcraft.
PRUDENCE: See, I told you!
AGATHA: (desperately) Your Honor, I swear on all that is HOLY, I'm innocent! I just have a passion for plants and a distaste for MEAT!
EZEKIEL: (thoughtfully) Very well. We shall adjourn for now and reconvene after lunch to deliberate.
TYPEWRITER: Two Hours at FRANCHISE Later
EZEKIEL: (addressing the courtroom) After two hours of careful consideration, and a combo meal at FRANCHISE, we have reached a verdict.
ABIGAIL: (eagerly) Guilty! She's guilty!
PRUDENCE: (nodding vigorously) Burn the witch!
EZEKIEL: (raising his hand for silence) However, upon further investigation,
EZEKIEL: it has become clear that Agatha's actions were not rooted in witchcraft, but rather in her dietary choices.
AGATHA: (hopeful) So you believe me, Your Honor?
EZEKIEL: Yes, Agatha. It is evident that you are not a witch, but simply a vegan herbalist.
ABIGAIL: (deflated) But... but what about the CAULDRON and the Incantations?
AGATHA: (smirking) The CAULDRON was for my vegetable stew, and the Incantations were just me singing to my plants.
PRUDENCE: (Embarrassed) Oh... I see.
EZEKIEL: (clearing his throat) In light of this revelation, Agatha is free to go. Case dismissed.

HORSE: Indeed. I've only revealed myself to you because you're obviously time travelers. I, too, am not from this time period.
LAURA: A talking, time-traveling horse named HNAME? I don't believe it. Are you part robot too?
KEITH: I'm just as shocked as you, honey. What can we do for you, HNAME? If you want, we can take you back to the future with us.
HORSE: No no, I'm quite comfortable here in 1876. CNAME treats me with dignity and respect, and I just love how the air smells of SMELL.
LAURA: What a weird horse.
KEITH: So why did you travel to this particular time then, HNAME?
HORSE: To put a stop to ONAME, the most fearsome outlaw in all the Wild West.

HORSE: In just a moment, ONAME is going to rob the old general store, ignite a bundle of dynamite, and blow up the ol' saloon. Well, I won't stand for it.
LAURA: You're very brave, HNAME. Anything we can do to help?
HORSE: Just stand back and watch. I've planned this whole encounter out.
gunshot
HORSE: Here he comes! Exactly as I planned, he just shot the general store owner.
LAURA: Couldn't you have stopped him before he gunned a man down?

OUTLAW: (enter stage left) Well howdy doody, folks of TOWN! It's me, ONAME, and I'm here to do some real mean outlaw stuff, like CRIME!
HORSE: Not so fast, ONAME. (meet OUTLAW at center stage)
OUTLAW: What in the God damn? A walkin', talkin' horse? (meet HORSE at center stage)
HORSE: That's right, ONAME. You can call me Sheriff HNAME. I'ma callin' you out, you no-good outlaw. Put down that dynamite and duel me.
OUTLAW: EXCLAMATION, I sure wasn't expectin' no sharpshootin' horse. Fine! (drop dynamite) 10 paces and we draw, unless you're chicken.
HORSE: On the contrary, ONAME. I'm a horse. Now get to walkin'. (turn around and start walking stage right)
OUTLAW: (turn and walk stage left) 1! 2! 3!
Meanwhile HORSE: 1! 2! 3!
KEITH: HNAME, I hate to ask, but do you even have a gun? How do you plan to shoot ONAME?
HORSE: (keep walking) 4! 5! 6! (to KEITH) It's in my saddle bag. As for how to shoot it, I... hadn't considered that.
LAURA: But if you can't shoot your gun, ONAME will win by default! I thought you planned this all out!
KEITH: I'll go get CNAME! He had a gun, right? There's still time!
HORSE: No, I can hear him with my incredible horse hearing. He's still ACTIVITY with GNAME. You'll never get to him in time. You'll have to take the shot for me.
KEITH: Ok! (grab the gun from HORSE's saddle bag and shoot OUTLAW in the back)
gunshot
OUTLAW: What in tarnation..? (fall over dead)
HORSE: That... wasn't exactly fair, but I suppose results are results. ONAME, the feared outlaw of the west, is dead. TOWN is saved.

LAURA: Well, Keith? What's wrong with it? Why haven't we been transported to MODERN?
KEITH: Great Scott! According to these readings, killing ONAME erased the event from history! And worse yet, attempting to go there drained the batteries again!

SCRIPT ==========================================
dark classical music
ALICE: (Pouring wine) Welcome, everyone, to my humble ABODE. I'm so glad you could make it.
BOB: I hope y'all came with an appetite or an excuse to drink, I'm breaking out the good WINE tonight.
CLAIRE: (Nervously) Um, you don't have to do that. We stopped by STORE on the way here and brought our favorite DRINK.
DAVID: We couldn't just show up without contributing to the festivities.
EMMA: (Sipping champagne) Good thing you did, it would have been embarrassing for you if you did.
EMMA: Yeah, why with the sudden celebration? We haven't heard from you lately. I thought you isolated yourselves again.
BOB: Now now Emma, I just happened to have some good MEAT and Alice thought it would be a good idea to share.
CLAIRE: Is there...something I'm missing?
DAVID: (Chuckles) Emma just being Emma, she's not afraid to call you out when you deserve it. .
ALICE: Emma, perhaps you shouldn't ask questions you don't want the answers to.
BOB: (Standing Between Alice and Emma) Hey, no need to be TOXIC. Why don't we just enjoy tonight?
Music Stops
EMMA: Oh I plan to (Walks to other side of room).
ALICE: (Mysteriously) I hope you do.
TYPEWRITER: Three hours and many glasses of WINE later.
BOB: Then I asked him, what do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!
laughter
EMMA: It's probably the booze (Hiccup) but is Bob actually funny?
DAVID: (chuckling) Oh definitely, that was TERRIBLE.
ALICE: Yet I still keep him around.
CLAIRE: (Chuckling tipsy) Alice, I do want to thank you for inviting us,
DAVID: Yeah, I know we haven't been on the best terms as of late. We had to take a step back after....
ALICE: It's fine. We totally get it. But how about one more to wrap up this soiree?
DAVID: We really should be going.
ALICE: Can I get everyone's attention?
ALICE: I'd like to thank you for coming, it truly has been an...insightful night. However, I can't keep up this farce any longer.
CLAIRE: Wait, what?
EMMA: Oh, finally this night is getting interesting.
ALICE: I've been eagerly waiting for the right time to do this. (pulls out a small vial of CHEMICAL from her pocket.)
ALICE: You see, while you were all being chummy and enjoying everyone's company, I've been spiking the WINE with CHEMICAL.

EMMA: What?!
BOB: This WINE? (Holds up his glass)
CLAIRE: Why would you do this?
EMMA: We didn't do anything to you?
ALICE: See Emma, that's where you're wrong.
EMMA: ...What?
ALICE: Remember FIRSTLOVE? He was my everything. We laughed, loved, and appreciated every moment with each other.
ALICE: But you had to take FIRSTLOVE away from me!
EMMA: But Alice, you ran over his RELATIVE with your CAR. You just got out of jail last year.
ALICE: (Irrational) I loved him! So now you must reap what you sow.
CLAIRE: Okay well Emma might deserve it, but David and I didn't do anything!
ALICE: Well...to put it in simple terms so you understand. I don't like you Claire. I wish I could never see your face again.
CLAIRE: (Gasps) Well I....
ALICE: However, I needed David to sell this idea of a party. His vibes are immaculate. (Fist bumps David)
DAVID: (Fist bumps Alice) Hell yeah.
DAVID: (To Claire Shrugging) What?
ALICE: Now I hope you had plenty to drink tonight...because now it's my turn to celebrate!
ALICE: (drinks from her glass, then collapses onto the floor.)
BOB: (Panicking) Alice! Why would you do this?!
CLAIRE: (Sobbing) I knew this was a bad idea!
DAVID: (Chuckling) This took a dark turn.
EMMA: And I didn't even get to finish my champagne.
BOB: (Slaps Alice) Wake up, Alice!
CLAIRE: We need to call an ambulance!
DAVID: I'll call 911! (dials 911)
CLAIRE: Bob, she's going to be okay. She'll have to go to jail again.
BOB: (Sobbing) It'll be her third strike...First CRIME, then FIRSTLOVE, now this?
EMMA: I might as well get another drink, I know where the good stuff is.(casually pours herself another glass of champagne.)
DAVID: (On the phone) Yes, we need an ambulance. Someone has collapsed!
EMMA: Well, this party certainly isn't going as planned.
CLAIRE: (Anxiously) Is she breathing?
BOB: I don't know! Alice, please wake up!

PARAMEDIC: Did she just drink too much WINE?
DAVID: No! It's more complicated than that.
PARAMEDIC: (Laughs) What, did she like, poison herself or something?
CLAIRE: (clears throat) Well...
PARAMEDIC: Seriously? This is more interesting than I thought.
PARAMEDIC: (To Stage Left) Hey! Get the camera and feed ready, we've got a live one!
PARAMEDIC: We need to get her to the hospital.
CLAIRE: (Tearfully) I can't believe this happened.
DAVID: I never thought dinner would end up like this.
BOB: What is this about a feed?
PARAMEDIC: Sir, this is the American healthcare system, we've got to make money any way we can.
PARAMEDIC: We're taking her to the hospital now. (Picks up Alice) One of you should come with us
PARAMEDIC: Also, if anyone else here ends up poisoned, call us back. Our audience loves a confusing story. (Exit Stage Left).
BOB: I'll go. (Follows PARAMEDIC)
CLAIRE: I'll stay here and clean up.
DAVID: I'll call her family and let them know which jail to find her in.
EMMA: At least tonight was interesting...who is up for another party once she's out?

ROOKIE: (nervous) I-I don't know s-sir! I haven't used a WEAPON before.
COP: I know I could, I have used a WEAPON before, not sure about with ACTIVITY though.
MOB BOSS: Well you see, I need loyal people in my family, otherwise, we might have problems.
MOB BOSS: But as for the ACTIVITY, It's necessary for my BUISNESS.

MOB BOSS: Well NAME how did they perform?
(dark classical music)
CAPO: Well as you can see here this one was nervous as a wreck however.
CAPO: (approach COP) This one did the ACTIVITY wonderful.
MOB BOSS: Hmmm, I see. Now I think NAME, we shall decide who is fit for the family.
CAPO: I agree boss, I think I know exactly who it might be though.
MOB BOSS: For the final question, and lets do this one at a time.
MOB BOSS: (approach ROOKIE) If there was a dirty ANIMAL in our midst what would you do?
ROOKIE: U-uhm, I would tell you bo-boss!
MOB BOSS: Even if it was your own family?
ROOKIE: (nervous) Y-yes I would!
MOB BOSS: Alright.
MOB BOSS: (approach COP) Same question for you.
MOB BOSS: If there was a dirty ANIMAL in our midst what would you do?
COP: (scoff) Well that's easy I would use my WEAPON to dispose of them and then report it to you boss man!
MOB BOSS: Even if they were family?
COP: Yeah I would, because you have to be loyal to be in the family.
COP: Unlike that one who's nervous as hell, I can use any WEAPON, for your ACTIVITY to help your BUISNESS grow.
MOB BOSS: Good answers from both of you.
MOB BOSS: This will be the final test.
CAPO: There is currently a dirty ANIMAL among us right now. Who is it? (load gun)
CAPO: (approach ROOKIE) Is it you? Are you the dirty ANIMAL?
ROOKIE: W-what!?! No it's not me!! I have been loyal and working for the bosses BUISNESS for years!!!
CAPO: (approach COP) Then could it be you? Are you the filthy ANIMAL?
COP: No sir, I proved myself when we went to do that ACTIVITY just now
COP: (points to ROOKIE) But I think it's him, he has shown that he's extremely nervous this whole time.
COP: Any normal employee for the boss from BUISNESS would not act as nervous as he has.
COP: He couldn't even use a WEAPON during the ACTIVITY we just did!
COP: A dirty ANIMAL would act so nervous just like he is!
CAPO: Alright you two have given your alibi's however.
CAPO: Times up.
(gunshot)
COP: (clench stomach) W-why? (dies)
ROOKIE: W-w-was it him!?
CAPO: Yes, he was the dirty ANIMAL, What gave it away was that he knew about Fat Tony.
MOB BOSS: Anyone who wasn't a dirty ANIMAL would not of known about Fat Tony.
ROOKIE: I suppose, I didn't even know about Fat Tony.
MOB BOSS: Well, you made it kid, your a part of the mob now.
CAPO: Well boss, (Point to dead body) what should I do with this mess?
MOB BOSS: That guy? Take out the trash, if you know what I mean.
CAPO: Right away boss, I'll get the tools.

SHERIFF: You're under arrest for robbing the Grand Central Railroad of all its CARGO!
Teleport BLACKHAT to Balcony
WHITEHAT: What are you talking about?! I ain't a criminal, I never done a train robbery!
WHITEHAT: And besides, would a criminal have bought their own boots, (point at your feet) and had 'em made in PINK?
SHERIFF: Are you gonna come quietly? Or am I gonna have to SHOOT you?
WHITEHAT: Heh, old man, you couldn't SHOOT a duck from twenty yards! Even on a good day!
WHITEHAT: You're lit up brighter than San Francisco on the Fourth of July!

SHERIFF: Are you inferrin' I'm drunk?
WHITEHAT: Absolutely not, old man! I'm implyin' it!

WHITEHAT: Oh really? (Point up at the back row of the audience) Can you tell the time on that there clock tower?
SHERIFF: Sure I can!

SHERIFF: I got all the probable cause I need right here! (Hold up a large tool)
WHITEHAT: What's that, old man?
SHERIFF: This is the WRENCH the engineer found on the tracks! The WRENCH you used to uncouple the wagon with all the CARGO in it!
SHERIFF: And it's not got a single fingerprint on it! Because you wore GLOVEs!

BLACKHAT: (Menacingly) Right. Nobody move a muscle, or the old man gets it!
BLACKHAT: Well well well, if it ain't my ol' partner in crime, WOODY!
WHITEHAT: I should've known you'd show up eventually, PINHEAD.
BLACKHAT: (Angrily, aiming at the good guy) That is not my name!
SHERIFF: WOODY! D-Don't you do anythin' stupid now!
BLACKHAT: (Anxiously, aiming at the sheriff) Shut up!
WHITEHAT: (Draw) You can't aim at two people at once, PINHEAD!
BLACKHAT: (Aim at the good guy) Dude!
WHITEHAT: If you put the gun down now and come quietly, everybody lives. If you SHOOT the old man, I'll SHOOT you.
WHITEHAT: But if you SHOOT me, you'll never learn where the CARGO is. Either way, you'll never get what you want.
BLACKHAT: CARGO? What CARGO?
WHITEHAT: I'm surprised you don't remember - it was your plan. You were asleep when we used that WRENCH on the Grand Central Railroad's wagon.
WHITEHAT: How embarrassing.
SHERIFF: W-Wait... So you did do the robbery?!
WHITEHAT: I sure did, old man.
SHERIFF: Then why are you helpin' me?

WHITEHAT: You seem to be forgetting one thing, PINHEAD. I know where the CARGO is.
BLACKHAT: (Angrily) That is not my name!
WHITEHAT: If you SHOOT me, you'll never know. But let's be gentlemen. I'll tell you here and now, then you got motivation to SHOOT me.
WHITEHAT: The old man's gone. We'll have ourselves a good old-fashioned quick draw. Winner takes all.
BLACKHAT: (Flustered) All-All right. Where is it?
WHITEHAT: It's in the abandoned MINESHAFT just outside town.

western jingle 1
SHERIFF: (Enter stage right) PINHEAD, you're under arrest for conspirin' to commit grand theft and attempted murder. You have the right to remain SILENT.
SHERIFF: (Hold out your hand to the good guy) Put it there, partner!
WHITEHAT: (Shake the sheriff's hand) Just how we'd planned it!

BLACKHAT: Y-You son of a gun! This was a setup the whole time?!
WHITEHAT: You seriously think I'd trust a drunk old guy with a loaded gun? You're an even bigger fool than I thought.
WHITEHAT: Good actin' by the way, sheriff, ol' PINHEAD swallowed it hook, line and sinker!
SHERIFF: Aww shucks, well at least it was a good case to retire on. And you were right, these ol' bones ain't what they used to be.
SHERIFF: I'm passin' on the sheriff's badge to you, son. Just as soon as this guy's sorry ass is behind bars!
BLACKHAT: (Frustrated) URGH! I knew I shoulda never trusted some guy in PINK boots to help me rob a train!
WHITEHAT: You'll be makin' PINK boots for the rest of your days where you're goin'!

PRES: Good evening fellow Americans. We are gathered here today to decide the fate of this new local hero.
Crowd woo
PRES: Just recently this person saved children and staff of a nearby elementary school from a DANGER attack.
PRES: And while they saved many lives... the school, which had existed since 1956, was destroyed entirely by a fire caused by POWER.
PRES: leaving some people to believe this vigilante should be punished for their crimes.
PRES: Joining us in the debate is NAME. Leader of Team TEAM. And on the opposing bench, you all might recognize as our charmingly snarky Vice President.
applause
VICE: I'm sorry but this is a waste of time. We should all go home now. This person in front of us shouldn't get to join Team TEAM.
VICE: I went to that school they burned down, and they were the best years of my life!
LEAD: As the leader of Team TEAM I believe this new hero has everything we are looking for in a member.
LEAD: I've seen them TALENT and they may even be better at it than me.
VICE: TALENT is not a talent. I could do that in my sleep. What does this person really offer? Look at them. They're scrawny and clearly unfit.
HERO: I have to disagree Vice President. I am as fit as a ANIMAL.
HERO: My strict fitness regimen of weight lifting and only eating FOOD has made me the strong hero who saved all those elementary kids.
PRES: FOOD huh? From this day forward I will make sure that FOOD is served in all the school lunches of America for the rest of time.
HERO: And might I add, if I get to join Team TEAM I would like to be known as Super Hero NICKNM.
LEAD: Super Hero NICKNM? That is the greatest name I've ever heard.
VICE: That was the name of our schools pet hamster who perished in the fire. You didn't save him did you Super Hero NICKNM!
HERO: I'm sorry that my POWER burned down the school.
HERO: I'm taking this name in honor of your school's pet hamster, and as a reminder of my biggest mistake. So I can be more careful in the future.
LEAD: See? Modest and caring. Super Hero NICKNM you are a national treasure.
VICE: National treasure? I'll bet they don't even know anything about this great Nation. Quick, name three American States!
HERO: um...New York, Texas and PLACE.
VICE: Haha! PLACE isn't a state. They're obviously not an American Citizen at all, and therefore can't join Team TEAM.
VICE: They deserved to be locked up for their crimes of burning down buildings!
HERO: I was just joking. It was a joke.
LEAD: (hysterical laughter) And they're funny too! If that isn't enough to convince you people, then I'm gonna have to bring in the big guns.

RUMSAY: It's time for another episode of Milkshake Factory, a show where I taste and rate epic, frothy combinations.
RUMSAY: That didn't sound right. I'm suing the teleprompter after this show.
RUMSAY: And today, I'm joined by my apprentice, APPRENTICE NAME, who makes an awful lot of terrible milkshakes and a lot of bad decisions in life in general.
APPRENTICE: They're not all bad. The one with INGREDIENT was actually pretty good.
RUMSAY: That milkshake somehow caught on fire.
APPRENTICE: You like it spicy. That's what you told me last night.
RUMSAY: (agitated) We'll discuss that later.
RUMSAY: Today, we're going to try a milkshake that I personally made. (takes shake from kitchen counter) This is the FLAVOR shake. Simple. Elegant.
APPRENTICE: Smells like catfish, but it's absolutely scrumptious if you don't know what's in it.
APPRENTICE: I've already prepared my will in the event I cease to be after drinking this. There is so much FLAVOR!
RUMSAY: Your tastebuds may file for divorce, your toilet will go on strike, and you may lose a BODY PART.
APPRENTICE: But rest assured, this will be the best milkshake you've ever had.
RUMSAY: Let's drink. Drink it up. (drinks milkshake)
APPRENTICE: Cheers to inevitable oblivion! (drinks milkshake)
Tense Cinematic Music
RUMSAY: And the verdict? APPRENTICE?
APPRENTICE: It's definitely not, not terrible. Lots of milk. Creamy, even.
RUMSAY: Yes. Lots of FLAVOR. Looks like you got some on your BODY PART there.
APPRENTICE: Better find a napkin to clean it off of me. Slowly (poses).
Waterphone
RUMSAY: No! That is inappropriate! This show is for GROUP! What is wrong with you? It's in the contract you wouldn't say those things.
APPRENTICE: Forget the GROUP. It also says in my contract that I wasn't allowed to put a OBJECT in the milkshake.
RUMSAY: Which you've done NUMBER times already. And even though I drank your milkshake NUMBER times and developed CONDITION, I always resented that I drank it.
APPRENTICE: You didn't tell me. And why did you drink it? Why must you punish yourself?
RUMSAY: Because milkshakes... Listen to me, APPRENTICE. Look at me in the eyes. Not on my BODY PART. Eyes up here. Look at me.
RUMSAY: Because milkshakes... bring all the GROUP to the yard. If you make a milkshake, I will be brought to the yard.
APPRENTICE: This is a kitchen.
RUMSAY: But metaphorically speaking, it is a yard. You're much too young to understand metaphors. They go over your head.
APPRENTICE: (looks up) I don't see anything.
RUMSAY: But my milkshake is better than yours. That's why I host this show. That's why GROUP love me.
RUMSAY: And they enjoy the milkshakes I make. But I couldn't make milkshakes without you, dear APPRENTICE.
RUMSAY: For so long, I couldn't make proper milkshakes. I spend long hours, days even, making milkshakes by myself in this kitchen.
APPRENTICE: And sometimes, those milkshakes were made prematurely.
RUMSAY: Other times I had to take CONDITION pills to make my milkshakes last longer than a hour. But then you came into my life.
APPRENTICE: I did a number of times.
RUMSAY: That's it! You're done! You've had your last milkshake!

Blanc: You never call a meeting like this. Especially not after the incident of YEAR.
Mario: (Looks at Blanc then looks at Nico) She's right sir. This has to be important if you are calling this meeting.
Nico: (Sternly) Don't remind me of the incident of YEAR. The Pasta linguine family had it coming. It was my only way of getting back at them.
Blanc: Back at them? Sir, we have ACTION with them before. Why DANCE?
Mario: No no, your thinking of ACTION with the New York Mets. or was it the Cowboys? I don't remember anymore.
Nico: (Angerly) SHUT UP BOTH OF YOU!!! Anyway, where is Serena? She has never been late. Was she practicing that stupid DANCE from PikPok again?
Mario: No, last time I checked in, she was with her boyfriend Marlo.
Mario: So she might be awhile since she cant pick what COLOR CLOTHING to wear.
Mario: I mean what are the odds of her coming through that door right now?

Serena: (Runs in out of breath) s-sorry I'm late! Marlo wanted to show me his TECHNOLOGY. I didnt understand parts of what he said but I
Serena: did finally meet his ANIMAL.
Serena: Plus I could not choose between this COLOR Ring the JOB gave me or the one Marlo gave me.

Serena: (Looks at Mario) Thanks for introducing me to your twin brother Marlo, Mario. I didnt know he was a JOB
Serena: Its too bad Mario, if only you were better looking and made better Pizza with TOPPING and extra spicy Chicken liver sauce.

Blanc: (Takes out knife) Can I stab her please before I do anything I would regret?
Mario: I think stabbing her would be something you would regret though.
Charles: (Barges into room acting crazy) What's up my pizza mafia brothers and sisters!! Whos ready to kick some FOOD butt!!
Mario: (whispers to himself) Why does Charles always have the energy from that one guy from SHOW?
Charles: I would have gotten here quicker, but I was having trouble with my TECHNOLOGY.
Charles: (takes out UNO deck from pockets) and look, I even brought UNO to play. Come on, I'll even let Nico shuffle the deck~
Blanc: (yelling) No one wants to play UNO! Who even is this person?
Nico: (Facepalming) That is Charles. Sadly, he's my younger brother. He thinks he is a part of this gang but he's not. Just pretend like he is not here.
Serena: (in shock) Wait a minute! You mean RainbowScytherHarem45645, the famous TECHNOLOGY reviewer on NachoTube is your brother?!
Charles: (embarrassed) Wow, you know who I am? I'm flattered. Gosh, I haven't been noticed since YEAR in STATE when I was eating FOOD with TOPPING.
Blanc: Can we please just start this God damn meeting already before I stab a JOB or Serena?
Mario: She's right. Lets just start because' im starting to feel chafing from my COLOR underwear

INVESTIGATOR: (enters room) Alright NAME, so why'd you do it?
TEENAGER: Do what?
INVESTIGATOR: Don't play dumb with me! I know you were behind the INTERNET crime.
OFFICER: The INTERNET crime?
INVESTIGATOR: Yes, the INTERNET crime! A crime so heinous, that it was enough to destroy the MONUMENT!
TEENAGER: You have no proof that I did that crime. I'd never do such an act.
INVESTIGATOR: Oh really? That's not what your FAMILY told me.
TEENAGER: My FAMILY? What did they tell you?
INVESTIGATOR: They told me that you've been acting very strange the past several months. Moreso since your friends all moved away.
INVESTIGATOR: Your FAMILY also told me you've been spending a lot of time online, looking up some very interesting topics.
TEENAGER: You're bluffing.
INVESTIGATOR: Oh, am I? Does the term, TOPIC, ring a bell?
OFFICER: TOPIC?
TEENAGER: Don't you dare.
INVESTIGATOR: Bringing up TOPIC has hit a nerve of yours, hasn't it NAME?

INVESTIGATOR: Are you ready to spill the beans now?
TEENAGER: Alright, I admit it. I was the one who caused the INTERNET crime.
INVESTIGATOR: Exactly. But what I want to know is, why? Why did you do it?
TEENAGER: After all my friends left me, I felt...EMOTION. I didn't know what to do.
INVESTIGATOR: And this EMOTION turned you towards TOPIC.
TEENAGER: Yes.
OFFICER: If you don't mind me asking. How are TOPIC and INTERNET connected?
TEENAGER: Is it really that hard to understand?
OFFICER: I mean...maybe a little.
INVESTIGATOR: Alright NAME, how about you explain?
TEENAGER: Fine.
TEENAGER: TOPIC has been growing in popularity recently, so I figured that would be a good way to try and reconnect with my friends.
TEENAGER: After spending countless days and nights studying TOPIC, I figured out a plan, involving acts from said game. It was foolproof.
INVESTIGATOR: Did you ever stop to think about the actions of your plan?
TEENAGER: I didn't think it'd go that far. Never far enough to destroy the MONUMENT.
INVESTIGATOR: But it did. Now all of those poor GROUP will never know the joys of the MONUMENT.
OFFICER: They'll never?
INVESTIGATOR: Never ever.
TEENAGER: I...I feel horrible about this whole ordeal.

TOM: (awkwardly) Uh, yes, Janet. Our very own Jerry Thompson—my best friend since TIME—has managed to, uh...
JANET: Authorities say Jerry was dared to lick a OBJECT by a group of young hooligans, and well, he took the challenge quite literally.

jazz music 1
DOCTOR: Good heavens Paddy, you're in a right old state! Tell me exactly what happened.
PADDY: Well now, that's a long story. I was knocked out at one point, but Mick was working with me so he can fill in the gaps.
MICK: It was his own bloody fault, I told him to just carry all the BRICKS down one at a time.
DOCTOR: BRICKS?
PADDY: Aye, we were working on that new HOTEL in DUBLIN, the one that was gonna open next month.
MICK: Me and Paddy had carried about HUNDRED kilos of BRICKS up to the top to do the work.
PADDY: And when we were done, I thought it'd be a good idea to lower the BRICKS down in a small barrel using a pulley.
PADDY: Eighty feet is a long way to carry stuff up and down by hand, and I'd already carried it up there once.
MICK: I told him it was a bad idea and I didn't want to get in trouble, so I just came down the ladder.
PADDY: I went down too, and tied off the rope on a BIKERACK, then I went back up and loaded the barrel with the BRICKS.
DOCTOR: And then what happened?
PADDY: Well, I came back down the ladder, held the rope tightly to support the weight, and untied the rope from the BIKERACK.
MICK: I tried to warn him, but he just didn't listen!
DOCTOR: Why, what happened then?
PADDY: Well to be sure, I was surprised! I was so surprised that I forgot to let go!
MICK: Paddy only weighed about half the weight of the barrel! He shot up in the air like a rocket!
PADDY: Next thing I knew, I was about forty feet in the air, and I met the barrel coming down as I was going up!
PADDY: I think I must have hit my HEAD on the barrel and broke it.
DOCTOR: The X-rays seem to agree with you there, Paddy.
MICK: But he kept on going up, up, up, until he got his HAND jammed in the pulley.
DOCTOR: Did you not think to let go by this point, Paddy?
PADDY: Doc, I got hit in the HEAD by a HUNDRED-kilo barrel of BRICKS! I wasn't thinking straight!
MICK: You weren't thinking straight when you untied the rope, you eejit!
MICK: Anyway, by this time the barrel had smashed into the BIKERACK and the bottom came off.
DOCTOR: I think I know where this is going. About HUNDRED kilos of BRICKS spilled out on the pavement?
MICK: Aye! And then what do you think happened?
DOCTOR: The barrel now weighed less than Paddy? So he fell back down and the barrel went back up?
MICK: You hit the nail on the HEAD, Doc!
PADDY: I just about regained my senses when I started falling again, still clinging on to the rope.
PADDY: I must've fallen about forty feet when I met the barrel again on the way up.
PADDY: I think I must have hit my LEGs on the barrel and broke them.
DOCTOR: You're right there Paddy, when the nurses examined your LEGs they found you had in fact broken both of them.
DOCTOR: And I have to say, we were impressed.
PADDY: Thank you Doc. But I kept falling, and the only thing that broke my fall was that big pile of BRICKS.
MICK: Yep, he fell right onto the pile, he landed right on his BACK, and he must have broke it in three places!
PADDY: By this time, I really was in a lot of pain, so much pain that I let go of the rope.
DOCTOR: You did what?!
MICK: He let go of the rope, Doc.
DOCTOR: But the barrel must have been eighty feet in the air again!
PADDY: Not for long, Doc. As I lay there on top of the HUNDRED-kilo pile of BRICKS, I saw the barrel hurtle back down towards me.
PADDY: But just before it hit me, I blacked out with all the pain.
MICK: That was probably for the best, it landed right on your RIBCAGE, and the rope followed it like a big string of spaghetti.
MICK: You were a mess.
DOCTOR: And then what happened?
MICK: I called for a paramedic, I said "He's lying on top of a big pile of BRICKS next to a broken BIKERACK," and they brought him here to you.
DOCTOR: Right. So you've got a broken HEAD, a mangled HAND, two magnificent broken LEGs, one broken BACK and one shattered RIBCAGE.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it doesn't look good for you, Paddy. What do you want me to do about it?

PETER: Enjoying the FOOD? I made 'em nice and juicy just for you.
ANDY: Yeah, man. Say Peter, an I ask you for some advice?
PETER: Sure, man. What's up?
ANDY: So, let’s say you’re, hypothetically, in a bit of trouble. Like, "Holy EXCLAMATION!" kind of trouble.
PETER: Hypothetically, huh? Okay, shoot.
ANDY: Right. So, let's say you need to VERB a lot of "stuff" from one PLACE to another.
PETER: (curious) Stuff? What kind of stuff are we talking about?
ANDY: You know, just packages. For a friend. CELEBRITY.
PETER: CELEBRITY? Really? Okay. And what kind of packages are we talking here, Andy?
ANDY: The kind of packages that make you really, really nervous if you get caught with them.
ANDY: The kind that make you sweat around your BODYPART.
PETER: Specifically your BODYPART?
ANDY: Like around that area, not necessarily on it.
PETER: Hold on. Are you talking about drugs?
ANDY: Drugs? Who said drugs? I didn't say drugs. Let's just call it "expensive INGREDIENT."
PETER: Uh-huh. And who’s looking for this "expensive INGREDIENT"? An angry chef?
ANDY: A very persuasive group of individuals. The kind who might come at you with a OBJECT if you disappoint them.
PETER: And they would use this OBJECT on you.
ANDY: Repeatedly, I'm sure.
PETER: Are these "individuals" covered in tattoos, possibly named things like "El ADJECTIVE Diablo"?
ANDY: Swing and miss. Definitely not. Maybe, though. This is all just a big "what if," right.
ANDY: We're just shooting the stuff. Guy talk. Things two dudes normally talk about in a backyard.
PETER: Andy, are you telling me you stole drugs from a cartel?
ANDY: What? No! I’m just asking for a friend. Let's call them CELEBRITY. And they'll need protection, obviously.
PETER: You mean like a WEAPON?
ANDY: Yes, obviously a WEAPON. CELEBRITY would need that to protect themselves.
PETER: (leaning in, intense) Okay, let's sum this up. You are in possession of a large quantity of stolen drugs.
PETER: The cartel is after you, and you're looking for advice on how to protect yourself?
ANDY: What should they do, Peter?
PETER: No. Stop with the hypothetical. I get it. You need help. Damn it, man!
PETER: (calmly) First, you need to get out of PLACE immediately. Then change his name to something ridiculous.
ANDY: Like CELEBRITY?
PETER: That name is clearly taken. Shut up for a second. You need to find a good hiding spot, like a OBJECT at the bottom of a lake.
PETER: Also, you might want to learn how to ACTIVITY because it could come in handy.
ANDY: Random, but fine. That makes sense. But what if he wanted to turn things around.
PETER: I know it's you, dude.
ANDY: He should make a romantic gesture instead.
PETER: A romantic gesture? To whom? The freakin' cartel?
ANDY: Well, what if this "friend" of mine just wanted to impress someone special?
PETER: By stealing drugs from a cartel and going on the run?
ANDY: (laughs awkwardly) No, no. What? No! I'm just seeking regular romance advice.
PETER: You're telling me that this other person over here is not in possession of stolen drugs.
PETER: And for this entire time, this entire hypothetical is about romantic advice?
PETER: (exasperated) Andy, I think your "friend" needs to get his priorities straight.
ANDY: (smiling) Thanks, Peter. That’s exactly what I needed to hear. I feel so much better now.
Gunshot
ANDY: (grinning) Hey, Peter. I need some more advice.
PETER: What now? What could your "friend," CELEBRITY hypothetically need at this very moment?

CLERK: Good evening! Did you find everything you were looking for today?
CUSTOMER: Oh, I found more than I was looking for.
CUSTOMER: You know, they say you can tell a lot about a person by the contents of their shopping cart.
CLERK: I suppose that's true. Let's see what you've got.
CUSTOMER: Prepare yourself. The journey through my cart will reveal everything.
CLERK: Alright then, let's get started.
CLERK: (scans item) Interesting choice. CHILDTOY?
CUSTOMER: The CHILDTOY symbolizes childhood innocence lost but never forgotten unless you're hypnotized.
CLERK: Hypnosis? Convenient, but the repressed memories do come out later. But forget about that. Moving on.
CLERK: (scans item) Pickled VEGETABLEs. A bit tangy for my taste, but to each their own.
CUSTOMER: Ah, but the pickled VEGETABLEs represent the layers of life, each one more pungent than the last.
CLERK: Here I thought it was you being pungent. My apologies. Next!
CLERK: (scans item) A FRUIT with sunglasses. Now that's just plain fun, right? But why the sunglasses?
CUSTOMER: The FRUIT is the king of fruits and the sunglasses shield it from the harsh realities of life.
CLERK: Makes perfect sense. But the FRUIT could also be blind.
CUSTOMER: Glad I saw that deal.
CLERK: (scans item) A shoe? Just one?
CUSTOMER: The lone shoe is a metaphor for the journey we walk alone in life.
CLERK: A poetic and unconventional choice. Okay, I can't argue with that.
CUSTOMER: I can't count up to two either.
CLERK: (scans item) I don't even know what to say about this one.
CUSTOMER: Ah yes, the taxidermy WORKER ANIMAL.
CUSTOMER: It reminds us that even in the stiffest of creatures, there lies great potential for service.
CLERK: I don't like how you phrased that.
CLERK: (scans item) Okay, now you're just messing with me. A whole gallon of LIQUID?
CUSTOMER: I really like LIQUID. Just one afternoon to cover my face with it.
CLERK: Alright, that's it. I can't take any more!
CUSTOMER: You can take more. But the LIQUID reveals something deeper.
CLERK: Oh yeah? What's that?
CUSTOMER: That you, my friend, are the owner of this store and the one who ordered all these strange items I bought.
CUSTOMER: You purchased this inventory. And I'm merely reclaiming it as part of my slow descent into insanity.
CLERK: Oh, I forgot I had a midnight brainstorm. I must have ordered all this when I was on SUBSTANCE.
CUSTOMER: Well, that explains the INSECTs.
CLERK: Yeah, no kidding. Those INSECTs are everywhere.
CUSTOMER: See you around, boss. Enjoy your jar of LIQUID.
CLERK: And I know I will while making uncomfortable eye contact with my cat.

ZARNOK: Good evening, everyone. I am your moderator, ZARNOK. I mean, Bob.
ZARNOK: Tonight, we have Joe Olden and Don Drumpf here to debate the future of this wonderful planet you call Earth.
ZARNOK: I have from Earth, by the way. There is no reason to be suspicious.
ZARNOK: Let’s start with something simple. Mr. Olden, people have concerns about your age.
ZARNOK: How do you respond to those who say you might be too old to serve another term?
JOE: Well, Jack, they say age is just a number. And in my case, that number is RNUMBER.
JOE: It's somewhere between "Too old for VIDEOGAME" and "Who pooped in my pants?"
JOE: But I’ve got the energy of men half my age!
Crowd Woo
ZARNOK: My name is Bob. I clearly stated this. Mr. Drumpf, same question. Are you fit to serve given your advanced years?
DON: Listen, I’m the most fit president you’ve ever seen. Out of a scale from 1 to 10 on fitness, I am a RNUMBER.
DON: In fact, I’m in tremendous shape. The best shape. People look at me and say, "Wow, how does he do it?"
DON: It’s because I have the best RNOUNs, perfect RNOUNs. People don’t know that. Tremendous RNOUNs.
JOE: Yeah, RNOUNs from the Jurassic period!
Laughter
ZARNOK: Interesting. Now, let’s talk about your fitness to lead.
ZARNOK: Mr. Drumpf, there are rumors you’ve been challenged by the PLANE of Air Force One. Your response?
DON: Fake news, all of it. Those PLANE are rigged. Everyone knows it.
DON: They’re made by radicals to make me look bad. In fact, I’m installing RNOUN2s in every building across America.
DON: Tremendous R2NOUNs. The best. You get on one and it takes you somewhere. It's going to be great.
JOE: Can I get one of those R2NOUNs in my house? Might help make the floors less slippery around here.
ZARNOK: Now, let's move on to something more serious. What are your plans for the future of healthcare?
JOE: We need healthcare that works for everyone. Free Band-Aids, discounted COUGH syrup from the local horse cart.
JOE: I promise to personally hand out DRUG to anyone who needs it. Check under your seats, folks. There is a giant pill.
Tada
DON: My plan is simple. The best doctors, the best medicine, and of course, the best prices.
DON: We’re talking about beautiful healthcare, folks. Beautiful. It's so beautiful, you would want to get sick.
ZARNOK: Alright. How will you handle the intergalactic threat. I mean, international relations?
JOE: Interga-what-now? Look, we need to be friends with everyone. I’m talking HUGs, people.
JOE: Big ol' HUGS for every world leader. Even the ones who don’t shower. Maybe especially those.
DON: I'll handle it the way I handle everything. With style, with class, and with tweets. They call them posts now.
DON: Lots and lots of posts. Upper caps. Everyone loves big letters. Not the tiny ones. They're like tiny BODYPARTs.
ZARNOK: I hear no woman likes tiny BODYPARTs.
DON: But some do.
ZARNOK: My last question. What is your message to the people of the United States of Earth?
JOE: Well, Jack. Look, we've come so far. And we need to come some more. Re-elect me and I'll buy you a FROZEN.
DON: Everything is terrible. Our great country has fallen faster than my opponent on stairs. Vote for me or I'll say it's rigged.
ZARNOK: Well, I think I’ve heard enough. After much consideration, I have concluded that Earth can neither be saved nor conquered.
ZARNOK: So, I’m going back to my home planet. Good luck, Earthlings. You’ll need it.

ROBERT: Thank you for inviting us over to your place, Daryl.
DARYL: Don't mention it. I know you guys really wanted to visit, so I thought, "Why not?" It's a beautiful day today.
DARYL: Speaking of which, why did you want to visit my backyard so badly?
HANK: (whispering) Hey, shut up for a second. Look at the bark on that one, man. It's got such a unique texture!
ROBERT: Oh yeah, that's a Quercus robur. The English TREENAME. You don't see those around here too often.
HANK: Look at those branches strutting their stuff! It's like it's dancing to some MUSICGENRE. You go girl!
DARYL: Y'all really out here tree watching? Seriously? What do you even see in these trees?
ROBERT: Daryl, it's like bird-watching, but better. Trees are so majestic, so grounded. They have stories, history!
ROBERT: This one here, for instance, could be over BIGNUMBER years old. Imagine the things it's seen!
DARYL: (sarcastic) Yeah, like kids playing catch and dogs peeing on it. Fascinating.
HANK: Don't kink-shame the trees, man. They've been on journeys.
DARYL: Journeys? Dude, trees don't move. They don't go anywhere.
ROBERT: No, really! You just have to look deeper. Every leaf, every branch tells a story.
HANK: Oh my gosh, look! The leaves are rustling in a peculiar way. It's almost like they're trying to communicate.
DARYL: Yeah, sure. Maybe it's saying, "Get these ADJPERSON people outta here."
ROBERT: Oh, we're not ADJPERSON. Bruh, we know where the action is at. That TREENAME has cake!

OAKUS: (enters stage right) Hello, humans. I am Oakus, the ancient tree spirit.
HANK: See, Daryl? I told you! The trees can talk!
ROBERT: Oakus, we are honored by your presence. What wisdom do you have for us?
OAKUS: I have stood here for centuries, watching the world change. And now, I must tell you something.
Silly music 2
OAKUS: You are all really, really high right now. Y'all smoke enough trees to see talking trees. Impressive!
DARYL: (laughing) Wait, what? Are you telling me this whole time we've just been hallucinating?
OAKUS: Indeed. Those FOOD you ate earlier were not just regular FOOD. I mean, it's possible they were simply really good FOOD.
OAKUS: But then you chewed on my tree bark for reasons I cannot understand. I liked it, though.
ROBERT: Oh man, this is too good. Tree watching while high. Classic.
HANK: No wonder the leaves were so captivating.
DARYL: I knew something was off. Trees don’t just start talking out of nowhere.
ROBERT: O wise Oakus! What other pearls of wisdom do you have to bestow on us lowly creatures?
OAKUS: Be mindful of the world around you or else you may become a viral Internet meme.
DARYL: Yeah, like a bunch of dudes talking to trees. Totally poggers. Won't be mid.
OAKUS: You are a grown CREATURE. Don't talk like that. Or maybe you aren't. I don't know. I might be high too, actually.
OAKUS: Oh! Appreciate the simple things. And always, always read the labels on your SNACKs.
HANK: There is so much to learn! So little time to actually follow through.
ROBERT: If the SNACKs are delicious, there is no reason to read the warning signs. Anything else, Lord Oakus?
OAKUS: Enjoy your trip, humans. But remember, the real magic of nature is in the sobriety of its beauty.
OAKUS: Oh, and by the way, your best friend has been a tree this entire time. You refer to him as Daryl.
ROBERT: Oh. Seriously? Well, that was one unforgettable tree-watching session.
HANK: Yeah, next time, maybe we should just stick to regular FOOD.
ROBERT: Or, you know, maybe try bird-watching. I hear they talk less.
HANK: That is really funny. What do you think Daryl. Daryl?

MOM: DADNAME, you have some explaining to do!
DAD: Well as i was driving back home i stopped by the pet store.
DAD: I was going to get a PET for CHILDNAME, but before i walked into the store, i was approached by a strange fellow.
DAD: He told me how he has a pet better than anything the store would sell me.
DAD: He kept going on and on about how good a household goblin was, and i bought one for MONEY.
MOM: MONEY?!?!
MOM: You know we were saving that money for SAVED!
MOM: And you spent it, on this?!

HOST: Contestant number 1, what's your excuse?
Gameshow Ring
CONTESTANT1: (Thinking) Hmm, Well, you see the thing is, I was on my way there, when...
CONTESTANT1: Suddenly I was stopped by a ANIMAL carrying a OBJECT! And to make it all worse worse, the weather turned into WEATHER!
Gameshow Ding
ACTOR1: (Enters acting as the animal facing towards actor 2) Excuse me CONTESTANTNAME1, can you help me with this OBJECT?
ACTOR2: (Enters acting as contestant 1) No I can't help you with your OBJECT, I am late to my wedding and it's raining WEATHER! And your a ANIMAL!
Laughter
HOST: (Laughs) That's quite an excuse, CONTESTANTNAME1! CONTESTANTNAME2, can you top that?
Gameshow Ring
CONTESTANT2: Oh, definitely! I was just about to leave my house when CELEBRITY called me, asking for help with a FOOD emergency!
CONTESTANT2: And then, out of nowhere, we were on a plane to PLACE!
Gameshow Ding
ACTOR1: (Acting as the celebrity) Hey CONTESTANTNAME2! I have a FOOD emergency, and I need your help right now!
ACTOR2: (Acting as contestant 2) Normally I wouldn't do this on the day of my wedding, but I could never say no to the ADJECTIVE CELEBRITY!
ACTOR1: Great! I hope you don't mind planes, it's the only way to get to PLACE.
Laughter
HOST: (Laughs) These excuses are getting better and better!
HOST: (Walk towards contestant 2 stand) Hey, CONTESTANTNAME2, you didn't happen to get CELEBRITY's autograph did you?
CONTESTANT2: Yea, I did actually, do you want it? I'll sell it to you for 8 million dollars.
HOST: 8 MILL- (Walk back to host stand) Okay, let's move on to our next scenario.
HOST: This time, you're late for an important job interview. What's your excuse, CONTESTANTNAME1?
Gameshow Ring
CONTESTANT1: Well, in my case, I was stuck in traffic, right? And then suddenly
CONTESTANT1: a ANIMAL parade broke out in front of me! So naturally, I had to join in and dance my way through it.
Gameshow Ding
ACTOR1: (Acting as a ANIMAL in a parade) Look at those dance moves on CONTESTANTNAME1!
ACTOR2: (Acting as contestant 1 in a parade) I love ANIMAL parades!
HOST: (Laughs) That's quite the sight, CONTESTANTNAME1! You really know how to turn a traffic jam into a party.
HOST: Now, CONTESTANTNAME2, what is your excuse for being late to an important job interview?
Gameshow Ring
CONTESTANT2: Well, you see HOSTNAME, I woke up this morning feeling like a million dollars.
CONTESTANT2: However, as soon as I stepped outside, I realized my car had transformed into a giant OBJECT!
CONTESTANT2: And not just any OBJECT, mind you—it had a mind of its own, and wings!
Gameshow Ding
ACTOR1: (Acting as a passerby) Is that a flying OBJECT car!?
ACTOR2: (Acting as CONTESTANTNAME2) Indeed it is! I tried to reason with it, but it was dead set on taking me for a joyride around town.
HOST: (Laughs) A flying OBJECT car with a mind of its own—now that's a new one, CONTESTANTNAME2!
HOST: That must have been quite the adventure. CONTESTANTNAME2, did you manage to explain this wild ride to your potential employers?
CONTESTANT2: Unfortunately, by the time the flying car decided to return me to solid ground, the interview had already concluded.
CONTESTANT2: They were quite understanding, though—everyone loves a good flying car story, right?
Laughter
HOST: Absolutely, CONTESTANTNAME2! Who wouldn't be captivated by a flying OBJECT car adventure? And CONTESTANTNAME1, your ANIMAL parade was equally as impressive.

SCRIPT ==========================================
STORY: Hello, boys and girls, and welcome to the show. My name is Resotski Tarkov, and I am going to tell you a story.
STORY: It is a nice story about triumph and hardship, about trials and errors. But anyway, let us begin.
sad chug jug music
STORY: Our story begins with a pilot named STEVEN. STEVEN was flying around northern Germany when something disastrous happened.
STORY: STEVEN forgot to check the ENGINE. With a yank and an awful crank, his plane started malfunctioning.
crashing debris
explosion
STORY: STEVEN's plane went tumbling down, crashing onto a mountain.
STORY: STEVEN would have been a dead man if there had not been a building on top of the mountain.
STORY: So, with all his might, STEVEN climbed to the building, which turned out to be a monastery.
PILOT: (limping on stage right) D-dammit, my leg is torn apart, and my plane is completely busted.
PILOT: (sighs) Well, it's a good thing this monastery is here. (shouting around) Hello... anyone here?
STORY: From a room at the back of the monastery, a monk came out to welcome STEVEN.
peaceful fantasy music
MONK: (enters stage left in a welcoming manner) Welcome, young one. What is your name, and what brings you here?
PILOT: My name is STEVEN, and I'm a pilot. My plane's ENGINE malfunctioned, and I crash-landed near your monastery.
STORY: STEVEN and the monk talked for a while as the monk tended to STEVEN's wounds.
STORY: Unfortunately, it would take around NUMBER months for help to reach the monastery, so STEVEN had plenty of time to get to know the monk.
MONK: Alright, your leg should be okay for now. I need to grab some things from the back room. Whatever you do, do not enter that room unless you are a monk.
STORY: STEVEN was puzzled by this statement, so he asked,
PILOT: (confused) Why can't I enter that back room? Is there something I shouldn't see? Something dangerous?
MONK: It is something only monks are allowed to see and know. (exits stage left)
STORY: This confused STEVEN even more, but STEVEN obeyed. Curiosity, however, got the better of him. While he was stuck at the monastery, he made a decision.
PILOT: (waiting for the monk to return) Hey, monk, can I become a monk like you?
meanwhile MONK: (re-enters stage left)
MONK: Hmm, that is possible, but it is a very painful and challenging process, young STEVEN.
PILOT: Bah, it’s nothing I can't handle. Besides, I’ve DIED before. There's nothing I can't handle.
STORY: STEVEN had never actually DIED before. He was too cowardly for that, but anyway...
MONK: Interesting, very interesting. You definitely have what it takes to become a monk.
MONK: To become a monk, you must complete three challenges that can span days, months, even years.
PILOT: Ah, don't worry. Once again, I’ve DIED before, so there's nothing I can't handle.
MONK: Alright, for your first test...
MONK: You must TEST1.
PILOT: Hah, that’s it? I'll get that done this evening, just you watch.
STORY: And so STEVEN went off to complete the first test, TEST1.
meanwhile PILOT: (moves to the front right of the stage and starts TEST1)
STORY: It took STEVEN 17 hours to complete the first test.
PILOT: Alright, monk, the first test is complete. (approaches the monk) Give me the next one.
MONK: Okay, little young STEVEN. Your next test...
MONK: You must TEST2.
PILOT: Another easy test. Here, monk, I'll get that done in one hour, just you watch. (moves to stage right)
STORY: It took poor STEVEN longer than just an hour; it took him NUMBER months to get it done.
meanwhile PILOT: (completing [TEST2])
STORY: But STEVEN eventually completed the task and went back to the monk.
PILOT: (out of breath) Alright, monk, second test complete. (approaches the monk) Time for the third one.
MONK: Indeed it is. It's time for the third and final test. Only then will you become a monk.
MONK: You must TEST3.
PILOT: Okay, that might be a little hard.
STORY: It wasn’t just a little hard; it was a monumental task. But STEVEN was determined to get it done.
STORY: For several months, STEVEN worked tirelessly to complete this third test.
meanwhile PILOT: (moves to the front right of the stage and starts TEST3)
STORY: STEVEN barely completed the test after two years, but finally, he had succeeded.
PILOT: (exhausted) F-finally, I’ve finished the tests. Monk, am I good to become a monk now?
MONK: That you are, poor little young STEVEN. But first, we must ACTION, then you will become a monk.
STORY: And so STEVEN did, and after all this time, he became a monk.
meanwhile PILOT: (performs ACTION)
PILOT: So, am I a monk now? Am I allowed to see what’s inside that door?
MONK: That you are, my adorable, poor little STEVEN. Come with me, and I shall show you what’s beyond this door. (exits stage left)
meanwhile PILOT: (follows the monk)
STORY: Now, kids, (walks to the middle of the stage) would you all like to know what’s behind that door?
STORY: It is something very special and very important.
STORY: The thing behind the door is...

STORY: Oh, it seems like that’s all the time we have left. See you next time, kids!

EGG: No, it’s me! The egg! You two monsters tried to order me.

EGG: Some you try to even to RANDOMVERB me! No respect.

EGG: Get it together, lady! This is all very real. I'm disappointed in you slowly realizing the gravity of this situation.

EGG: I’m here to make a stand. Why should we eggs be your breakfast victims every day? It’s exhausting!
MIKE: (nervously) Uh, what do you suggest we do, Mr. Egg?
EGG: How about a nice bowl of cereal with some ANOTHERFOOD on top? Leave us eggs alone for once!
MIKE: (stunned) This is insane. We can't just stop eating eggs!
EGG: Why not? You must be cracked. How about I toss you in a frying pan every morning?
SARAH: Maybe it’s time we rethink our breakfast choices. This egg makes a point.
MIKE: (reluctantly) Okay, okay. No eggs. Waiter!
WAITER: (enters stage right) Yes?
MIKE: Change of plans. No eggs. The egg over here told me to have no eggs.
EGG: Eggxactly. This is a tremendous breakthrough!
SARAH: What do you recommend that's different? We've never not had eggs before. This is uncharted territory.
WAITER: How about our baby CREATURE? Very popular.
SARAH: I think we'll both have that.
EGG: You’d switch to a baby CREATURE just like that? What is wrong with you people?
MIKE: Other than us suffering massive BODYPART wounds when we were kids, we're perfectly fine.
SARAH: Maybe we should just have pancakes and toast.
MIKE: (sighs) Yeah, pancakes and toast sound good.
WAITER: Perfect! I'll place the order, and hope I never see the two of you and the imaginary egg again.
EGG: (relieved) Now that’s more like it. Enjoy your breakfast. You too are not so bad after all.
EGG: Wait a minute! Pancakes use eggs. My fate is cooked!
MIKE: Mission accomplished, everyone. We made a talking egg happy!

FRED: Why would you even drink that? Are you insane? It's late. I have work in the morning.
FRED: So can you please, for the love of RANDOMNAME, can you turn down your music some?
PAUL: You're only upset because you don't appreciate good music. You're not culturally refined.
KELLY: Do you know who MUSICIAN is? They have so much depressing music.
PAUL: They really brings out the alcoholism in us.
FRED: This music is so depressing, and you’re blasting it like it’s a party anthem! Why?
KELLY: Oh, poor Fred. It’s not about the volume, it’s about the soul! This music touches our part of the body.
PAUL: Specifically the BODYPART. We just touch and touch. So much touching.
KELLY: Fred, you’re just too uptight. Have you tried VERBING a little?
FRED: Yes, I do. And maybe more than a little, but that's not the point.
FRED: I just don't understand why you would play the kind of music that plays in sad ANIMAL shelter commercials.
KELLY: It's about getting in touch with your feelings.
FRED: (angry) Stop using the word "touch." Very unsettling.
PAUL: (hiccup) You know what, Kelly? Maybe our imaginary neighbor is right. We should play something more uplifting.
KELLY: Couldn't agree with you more, honey! After you do that, let's have another DRINK.
FRED: Okay, first off: I'm not imaginary. Second, I didn't say anything about playing something more uplifting.
FRED: And come to think of it, I'm actually terrified of what you consider "uplifting." Just please keep it down.
KELLY: I can really go hard with this. It's making my BODYPART flutter! Who wrote this song?
PAUL: I think MUSICIAN did this. They've been producing an awful lot of bangers lately.
FRED: Awful is right. Starting to suspect both of you are playing me. What have I done to deserve this?
KELLY: Paul, I think Led Zeppelin did this. What was the other song they did that I like? Stairway to Heaving?

PETER: This is in case OBJECT goes bad or doesn’t meet the taste standards.

JAMIE: Yeah, well, it seemed pretty expensive.
CHRIS: I didn't even ring you up yet. And you're not buying an OBJECT. You're buying a GIFT.

BRITISH: I finally have a few leads on their whereabouts.
BRITISH: (about to open file)And it's aaalllll in this file rigghhtt here.
(bluegrass music)
(break down door)
WESTERN: (slams door open) YEEEEEEEEHAWWW!
Meanwhile BRITISH: JESUS CHRIST!
BRITISH: What the heck-
WESTERN: (walks into the room and starts searching everywhere) Pleasure ta' meet ya', pardner. Carry on, don't mind me.
BRITISH: (stammering) I-I.. who the heck are you and why are you just casually going through my things?!
WESTERN: Sorry for bustin' down the door there, sir.
WESTERN: (closes door) Might as well introduce myself while i'm at it. Name's COWBOY NAME. I'm the best detective from the whole wide west.
BRITISH: Really? That's your name?
BRITISH: Whatever. Why have you come all the way down here just to turn my office upside down?!
WESTERN: Oh don't worry there, sir. I didnt come all the way here to trash your space. I'm lookin' for something obviously.
BRITISH: What are you looking for anyway?
WESTERN: Well, a lil' birdy told me that some detective in England had leads on a specific bandit i've been tryna catch.
WESTERN: That detective being you I assume. (looks at the file in his hands) And that being the leads.
BRITISH: Well...um... I..... (tries to hide the file behind his back)
WESTERN: (approaches him slowly) You don't mind if I take that do ya'?
BRITISH: Stay back, I worked hard to get this!
(music stops)
(telenovela sting 1)
(break down door)
SPANISH: (slams door open and walks in quietly)
BRITISH: And who are you?!
(telenovela music 1)
SPANISH: My name is not important. I'm here to retrieve some information for a case that I have been assigned to solve.
BRITISH: Wait.... you're a detective too?
SPANISH: How did you know who I am?
BRITISH: I don't know who you are. All I know is that you aren't getting anything out of me.
SPANISH: Listen here, you pipsqueak. I am the best detective in all of Spain.
SPANISH: So I suggest you hand over the information that you have gathered to me or I will not hesitate to HORRIBLE ACTION to get it out of you myself.
WESTERN: I sure as heck am glad that I ain't in your shoes right now.
BRITISH: I.......
(french music)
FRENCH: (walks in)
BRITISH: Ah, hello there young lady, is there anything I can help you with?
(break down door)
FRENCH: (slams the door closed)
BRITISH: What is with all of you and door slamming?....My poor door....
FRENCH: Bonjour monsieur. I am Lady FRENCH NAME.
BRITISH: Let me guess, the best detective in all of Paris or something?
FRENCH: No. I am the best detective in all of France.
BRITISH: (sigh) Of course you are.
FRENCH: I heard you have information on the "LITERALLY ANYTHING" case. So if you would just hand it over to me that would be highly appreciated.
(music stops)
(telenovela sting 1)
SPANISH: Enough of all of this. I have solved hundreds, if not NUMBER of cases more than the three of you combined.
SPANISH: So it is only logical to hand me that file.
WESTERN: Ya' know I've finally realized who you are. I've seen you around before.
(silly music 2)
WESTERN: Yer' that hernandez fella aren't ya? Yeah, that SPANISH NAME hernandez.
WESTERN: The guy who was caught using a STRANGE DEVICE to spy on people and gather information to solve most if not all of his cases.
SPANISH: I.... I only used it for a few of my cases. Not all of them!
BRITISH: So much for the best detective of spain.
FRENCH: Well monsieur hernandez is obviously not suited for the task. Which means I am the best.
BRITISH: And why is that?
FRENCH:(approach the british detective) I am a master seductress. I get people to talk no matter how hard-headed they are.
FRENCH: I have connections with people across the world. Even celebrities like CELEBRITY.
FRENCH: If you give me that file, I am bound to be able to track them down and make him confess for his crime.
BRITISH: I-I see....
(tense cinematic music)
WESTERN: Now hold your horses lil' lady. First off I don't think being a world-class cougar is a skill to be proud of.
WESTERN: Unlike me, I've got the skill of being able to tell what specific type of WEAPON was being used based on the markings they leave.
WESTERN: And second of all, I was here before you two were. So clearly I was faster at tracking people down than the two of you ever could.
WESTERN: So i'll be the one here takin' that file, thank ya' very much.
FRENCH: How dare you call me such terrible things, who do you think you are.
SPANISH: I agree with the silly cowboy. Your talent isn't as lavish as you make it out to be.
WESTERN: Woah there, who ya callin' silly buddy? You tryna' provoke me or somethin'?
FRENCH: You two are horrible detectives. I do not understand how anyone would pay you two to solve anything.
WESTERN: Quite the mouth you got lil' lady. Might wanna watch it.
SPANISH: You have a sharp tongue as well, if you're going to be able to give it, you have to be able to take it.
WESTERN: You wanna go, "mister MEXICAN FOOD?"
(music stops)
BRITISH: By jove, Enough!
(waltz music)
BRITISH: Look at the three of you. Fighting like children over candy. Completely unprofessional if you ask me.
BRITISH: Each of you claiming to be the best detective, despite acting the way you are. Shameful.
BRITISH: But in a way all three of you are right. You three are the best detectives. Because you're the best at what you do best.
BRITISH: And if we all work together, we can catch this guy in no time.
BRITISH: COWBOY NAME. You're good with WEAPON identifying right?
WESTERN: Yeah...why?
BRITISH: Here's the pictures of the WEAPON markings on the crime scenes all over town. If you're willing to help, find out which WEAPON was used.
WESTERN: You can count on me, pardner. (Leaves the room)
BRITISH: Hernandez, you're good with spying aren't you?
SPANISH: That's right...
BRITISH: Here's the map with special markings on what I suspect is the culprit's next targeted crime scenes.
BRITISH: Try to keep an eye out on any suspicious individuals in those places. And if anything happens tell me.
SPANISH: ....thank you. I will not let you down. (Leaves the room)
BRITISH: Lady FRENCH NAME. Here is the list of people who have done business with our culprit.
BRITISH: If you are able to, maybe you can talk to them and get even more intel on his whereabouts.
FRENCH: (kisses his cheek) Merci, monsieur. Your trust in me will not be in vain. (Leaves the room)
BRITISH: (walks to the center of the room) It's getting quite late outside, I should probably get back to the crime scene.
BRITISH: It's been quite a day today, this whole situation was really unexpected. But then again, it wasn't really a problem.
BRITISH: (walks towards the door and turns to audience) After all, the best detective can handle anything can't they? (leaves the room)

Jim: Linda would you shut up! these two gentlemen know more than you about what is or isn't a sin
Linda: Alright, Brother Wells what other sins are there?

Tom: I can't afford that! I already spend NUMBER percent of my allowance on PURCHASE.

Wells: (Dramatic gasp) That's two sins in one act!
Jim: (Heartbroken) Tom I can't believe this.
Linda: Jim it's normal for kids his age to spend NUMBER percent of their money on PURCHASE.
Jane: (excited) Tell us more sins! Tell us more sins!
Wells: Well our church strictly prohibits the marriage between Man and NOUN1.
Jim: Tom please tell me that you don't intend to ever marry a NOUN1.
Tom: I mean... I don't know I kinda think NOUN1 is hot.

Jim: Oh my FAITH. My son is damned to go to hell.
Price: Not exactly, he can still be forgiven! and he didn't do the unforgivable sin.
Linda: What's the unforgivable sin?
Price: It is the forbidden word, If you say it you will be punished by the wrath of FAITH.
Jane: What's the word?
Price: The word is RANDOM
Tom: But didn't you just say it.
Price: I did, but it was in order to teach you not to say it. I'm sure FAITH would understand.

SCRIPT ==========================================
World news intro
MODERATOR: (Monotone) Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to tonight's debate on the age-old question: CANINES or FELINES? In one corner, we have the ever-charming, CELEBRITY.
DEBATER #1: Thank you, thank you. CANINES all the way, baby!
MODERATOR: (Monotone) And in the other corner, we have...uh...an unknown individual who signed up last minute. Let's call them, uh, NOBODY.
DEBATER #2: FELINES rule!
MODERATOR: (Yawns) Alright, let's make this quick. CELEBRITY, you have the floor.
Badass music 1
DEBATER #1: CANINES. They're loyal, always happy to see you, and they ACTION! What more could you want? They're basically fluffy bundles of joy and loyalty.
DEBATER #2: Mind you, FELINES are also fluffy bundles of joy and loyalty.
DEBATER #1: Even so, CANINES are always down for adventure-hiking, swimming, and ACTIVITY? They're like your own personal cheerleaders.
DEBATER #2: They're more akin to slobbery chaos machines that eat your shoes and wreck your home, then they are cheerleaders.
DEBATER #1: Factually untrue. What is true, is that you'll never be lonely with CANINES around, and that they're great listeners.
DEBATER #2: So are FELINES. And guess what? They SOUND. It's like having a tiny, furry OCCUPATION on call.
MODERATOR: (Checking watch) Fascinating. I'm enthralled, really.
DEBATER #2: Also, you can be gone for a weekend, and they'll be fine. And have you seen FELINES jump? It's like watching a ninja in action. They're independent.
DEBATER #1: Independent? More like indifferent. CANINES are always there for you, through thick and thin. They're your ride-or-die companions.
DEBATER #2: Unless there's a MAMMAL. Then you're on your own. Also, FELINES don't need walks at 6 AM in the freezing cold.
DEBATER #1: All part of the bonding experience. Plus, CANINES are great for your social life. Take one to the park, and you're suddenly the most popular person there.
DEBATER #2: Yeah, if you enjoy getting slobbered on by all the CANINES in a 5-mile radius.
MODERATOR: Ain't that the truth.
DEBATER #1: Aren't you supposed to be indifferent here?
MODERATOR: I'm not paid enough to care.
DEBATER #1: Anyways, FELINES act like they're doing you a favor by existing.
DEBATER #2: Not true!
Music Stops
Record scratch
VIEWER: (Barging in) Hold on a second. Stop everything!
MODERATOR: And what seems to be the problem?
VIEWER: I'm here to say this whole debate is pointless! Everyone knows that the true superior pet is...a ANIMAL.
Happy music 1
DEBATER #1: A ANIMAL?
Meanwhile DEBATER #2: A ANIMAL?
VIEWER: Exactly! No hair, no loud noises, and no dead animals. Just pure, sweet bliss and serenity. They won't beg for food, or wake you up at 5 AM.
DEBATER #1: Hold it, is this even allowed? They're not even a part of this debate!
MODERATOR: (Interested) No, let them cook. They might be onto something...
VIEWER: Thank you. And, if we need reminded, a ANIMAL won't destroy your house or SECRET when you aren't around.
MODERATOR: Folks, I think we might have a winner here.
VIEWER: Thank you for seeing the obvious answer. Now, can we all just go home?
DEBATER #1: Aren't we allowed a closing remark first?
MODERATOR: Nope! Debate adjourned!

EMILY: Are you sure you want to do this, Tom? I know you said you’re not big on parties.
TOM: Yeah, you know me, Emily. I’m just so EMOTION. I don’t know anyone here.
TOM: I'll probably just stand in the corner and eat SNACKs.

EMILY: (turning to Tom, bewildered) World Polka Finals? Tom, what is he talking about?
TOM: It's just a hobby I do sometimes. It's nothing really.

EMILY: Looks like she's still pretty sore about it. You’re telling me the world’s best polka dancer is afraid of a rematch?

CHAD: Alright, alright, let's be professionals here. We just experienced an earthquake, and the people need to know our ratings.
SANDY: My AGENUMBER year old son told me we can go viral if we rate things that don't normally get rated.
SANDY: So I’m gonna go with a 5.5. The shaking was decent, but I wasn’t, like, scared scared, you know?
PHIL: Yeah, not like MOVIE scared, although some parts of that movie make me feel funny inside.
SANDY: You know what? I might downgrade to a 6. It didn’t even knock over my picture of my cat, Mr. CATNAME.
PHIL: Wait. Mr. CATNAME my cat.
SANDY: Our feline child made a decision of who they wanted to live with.
CHAD: My quake baseline is when I start regretting not making that will.
CHAD: This didn’t even make me check if my BODYPART insurance was up to date.
Crashing debris
CHAD: Whoa! Aftershock!
SANDY: (cheerful) Ooh, baby! 6.8! I felt a little more tingle with that one!
CHAD: What kind of tingle? Tell me more.
PHIL: Please, Sandy, that was barely a 3. Come on, it felt like someone dropped their TOY upstairs. Let’s be real here.
CHAD: (serious) Now, let’s discuss. What would it take for a 10 out of 10 earthquake?
SANDY: (excited) Okay, picture this: The quake happens, and you suddenly find yourself doing the DMOVE involuntarily.
SANDY: And your CLOTHING pop off. That’s at least a 9.5, right?
PHIL: Oh, that’s strong. It's like when the clothes of an Anime girl magically disappear after eating something tasty.
CHAD: We're concerned about you, Phil.
CHAD: But for me, a perfect 10 earthquake would have to include a spontaneous conga line.
CHAD: No discussion. Just the force of the quake somehow making everyone conga.
SANDY: Bonus points if the conga line leads to a bar! I don't like sobriety.
PHIL: For me, it’s simple. If the quake can shake loose the emotional trauma of my last LEVENT, it’s a 10.
PHIL: Or if the quake literally flips the studio upside down, but I’m still in my chair and on fire.
PHIL: Yeah, fire would be a plus. Just burn the whole PLACE down.
CHAD: Seriously, Phil? Did you skip medication day?
Crashing debris
CHAD: What the heck? Is this part of the quake?
SANDY: (giggling) I think the earthquake just took us to Funky Town!
PHIL: (resigned) It’s official. This is a 10.
CHAD: Alright, everyone, we know what to do. Let’s get this conga line started!

CLERK: Ah, good afternoon! Lovely day, isn't it? We’ve got a special on "Diet LIQUID" today. Only slightly less watery than the regular kind!
CLERK: More creamy. Made fresh.
CUSTOMER: Oh, that sounded refreshing until you said "creamy" and "fresh" too closely together.
CUSTOMER: You know, I think I’ll take a look around the store. You don't mind holding onto my little one for a minute, do you?
CLERK: Sadly, I do mind, only because I need to run the store. I can't just keep my eyes on him.
CUSTOMER: (walks toward shelf) He's fine. Bye-bye, sweetie!
CLERK: I think you left your child over here?
CUSTOMER: You’re the babysitter now. He’s yours. Good luck keeping an eye on him while you try to do your job!
BABY: So, what’s the plan, chief? You gonna start changing diapers, or do you need me to show you how to run the SMACHINE?
CLERK: Wait a second. You can talk? And just so you know, I know how to run a SMACHINE. But I sometimes get cramps.
BABY: Yeah, shocking, right? And I’m potty trained too, just in case you were worried.
CLERK: Pretty sure you were looking to be changed. Smells like old FOOD in here. Can't imagine why.
BABY: So, what’s the deal with this place? You’ve got more types of VEGGIES than you have customers.
CLERK: I shouldn't answer to an infant that's clearly possessed by an adult.
SHOPPER: (enters stage right) Oh, what a precious little CREATURE! Is this your son?
CLERK: What? No! No, he’s not mine. Some random customer just left him here!
CLERK: By the way, not a CREATURE. Maybe a little hairy. Maybe CREATURE-adjacent.
SHOPPER: How dare you! Abandoning your responsibilities! Honestly, the nerve of some people.
SHOPPER: Just because he’s small doesn’t mean he’s not yours! Take some responsibility!
CLERK: (frustrated) No, you don’t understand! He’s not mine!
BABY: Denying responsibility? Typical left. They probably left me with you because I started talking about ACADEMIA too early.
CLERK: How would you know anything about ACADEMIA? Actually, you know what? Never mind.
SHOPPER: You should be impressed, sir! A baby's first words are usually "Mama," "Dada," or "RNOUN."
SHOPPER: But your baby is special. Very special.
CLERK: Special? I think the word you're looking for is BADJECTIVE.
SHOPPER: Rude! I will never shop here again unless there's something I'll need later!
CUSTOMER: (returns to checkout) Oh, look, he’s making friends already! Ready to take him back?
CLERK: (desperate) Please take him back!
CUSTOMER: Nah, I think he’s having fun. Besides, I’ve got more shopping to do. Keep the change. (exists stage right)
CLERK: You're leaving this pint-size nightmare here? No, please. Where are you going?
BABY: Sorry, mate, but I’ve got my own shopping to do.
SHOPPER: You should be proud your son is independent. Bet you weren't like that at his age.
CLERK: Back when I was his age, I could barely speak. I think the only word I knew was "RWORD."
BABY: What depths of your depraved mind did you pull that word out of?
CLERK: I need a vacation.
BABY: Ring me up, big guy. And make it snappy, I’ve got a conference call in five.
SHOPPER: You should really give him a raise.
CLERK: I keep telling you. He's not my child.

BABY: (crying) Well you didn't have to wreck my feelings! I'm just a year old.
CLERK: I don’t get paid enough for this.

BABY: Finally. I was about to nap time, but I can call to reschedule.

JAR: (Whispering to PAWN) So it would seem...
BIGGLES: (Whispering to JAR) We should be careful, he may be TESTing us!
JAR: (Whispering to PAWN) In that case, we should TEST him!
JAR: Aha... We are very pleased to see you, please do not worry about being late.
JAR: We'd just... like to ask you some questions. Please, take a seat.
ALEX: Thank you. (Sit down) Would you mind if I left my BRIEFCASE on the table?

JAR: (Whispering to PAWN) He is starting to sound more and more like the Chosen One.
JAR: After all, the ancient texts do mention one who is good at BANKing.
PAWN: (Whispering to JAR) Should we trust him?

JOSHUA: Well, well, well, it’s me, Joshua Weissmore, back again to teach you mere mortals how to cook FADJECTIVE food.
JOSHUA: Because let’s face it, if CELEBRITY is the king of the kitchen, then I am basically a kitchen deity.
JOSHUA: Remember to smash the like and subscribe button if you like me VADVB yelling at you.
JOSHUA: You see, the secret to making the perfect dish is to first understand you'll never be as good as papa.
JOSHUA: But don’t worry, I’m here to help you get somewhat close. Let’s start by VERBing this dough.
JOSHUA: It should have the consistency of a SMOBJECT, which is something you probably can’t manage without screwing it up.
JOSHUA: But if you manage to VERB the dough enough to make it more consistent than a SMOBJECT, I'm still a genius.
JOSHUA: Now, add exactly NUMBER grams of flour. Not 41, not 43.
JOSHUA: If you deviate, you might as well be cooking CREATURE on a bonfire at a Renaissance fair. Peasant!
JOSHUA: Use a scale for the dough. Don't have one? What are you doing with your life? Just eyeballing it? Please.
JOSHUA: That’s a one-way ticket to mediocrity or a date with CELEBRITY. Don't do it. You don't know where they've been!
JOSHUA: Now, it's time to add a generous dollop of INGREDIENT. You want to be liberal here. Don’t be shy. Get in there deep.
JOSHUA: After all, no one likes their INGREDIENT underwhelming and under-performing. It only happened once.
JOSHUA: Then, of course, you have to work the dough with your BODYPART, really give it a good squeeze. Get it nice and firm.
JOSHUA: After all, you can’t have a good dough without some solid kneading action, if you know what I mean.
JOSHUA: Right, now that we’ve absolutely manhandled this dough, we’re going to roll it out with a KTOOL.
JOSHUA: Now, you want to apply just the right amount of pressure. Too little and, well, nobody’s satisfied.
JOSHUA: Too much and, oops! You’ve gone and made a mess. It only happened once. Like and subscribe.
JOSHUA: Wait. Did I just catch a whiff of inferiority? Are you using store-bought ingredients?
JOSHUA: Listen, if your olive oil wasn’t harvested by monks in PLACE under the light of a full moon, is it even worth using?
JOSHUA: Behold, bread. It’s not just bread. It’s an experience. It’s the culmination of NUMBER hours of artisanal labor.
JOSHUA: You, of course, could never replicate. But, don’t worry, you’ll get there. Maybe. if you follow my instructions.
JOSHUA: (tastes) Mmm. That is FADJECTIVE. But you know what? It’s not just the taste. It’s the fact that I made it.
JOSHUA: Oh! And before I forget, you’ll definitely want to stay tuned for my upcoming videos.
JOSHUA: I'll be reviewing some of the most popular fast food items like the JUNKFOOD.
JOSHUA: Because, you know, sometimes it’s important to remind myself why I’m superior.
JOSHUA: Spoiler alert: They’re not even in the same universe as what I just made here.
JOSHUA: But hey, at least I’ll have a reason to be even more satisfied with my culinary genius.
JOSHUA: And if this impresses CELEBRITY, I hope they give me another chance. It only happened once.

KYLE: There. The perfect pyramid of kombucha. Can’t wait to see how many likes this gets on the store's SOCIAL.
JAZMINE: (to Tyson) Yo, what's good? I’m trying to cop something with, like, major drip.
JAZMINE: Something that’ll get me mad likes, you feel me?
TYSON: (nodding) Bet. We just got some new fits in the back that are fire.
TYSON: You trying to get something that's lowkey flex or you going full savage mode?
JAZMINE: You already know, I'm on my demon time today. Gotta keep it 100.
KYLE: Hey, Tyson, Jazmine. Uh, what exactly are you two talking about? Something on fire? Do we need to call someone?
TYSON:Nah, Kyle, we’re just CVERB. Jazmine’s looking for something that’s got that drip, you know? Like, major sauce.
KYLE: (genuinely confused) Sauce? Like LIQUID? What does that have to do with clothes?
JAZMINE: Nah, not LIQUID, my guy. Really, though? LIQUID? Dang, dawg.
JAZMINE: Drip is like your style, your swag. The sauce is how you flex it.
KYLE: Why does everything sound like a food item? Drip, sauce, flex? This is like trying to read a menu at a hipster brunch spot.
KYLE: And then I get slapped in the BODYPART by a hipster barista's manbun because I can't figure the menu out.
TYSON: (laughing) Yo, Jaz, my man Kyle is straight wildin’. He’s giving me “out of CLOTHING” vibes right now.
JAZMINE: (nodding) Facts. Big “no cap” energy. No CLOTHING at all.
KYLE: (getting defensive) Wait a minute. I don’t know what "no cap" means, but I do know that I’m not wildin'!
KYLE: I'm just trying to understand why y'all sound like you’re speaking in tongues like CELEBRITY on crack!
TYSON: True. They be like that. Okay, okay, I got you. No cap means no lie. Like, we’re keeping it 100% real.
TYSON: Wildin' just means you’re acting a little crazy, but in a fun way. But you get wild, though.
KYLE: (sarcastic) Oh, great, that clears everything up. And by “clears everything up,” I mean I’m even more confused!
KYLE: What happened to good old-fashioned LANGUAGE? No reason for it to be so overrated.
JAZMINE: LANGUAGE? What is that? Sounds like major drip.
JAZMINE: Bruh, you gotta get with the times. It’s all about the vibes, the energy. You can’t be out here moving like a boomer.
JAZMINE: Like one of those PERSONs who is just mad about whatever we like, and then they die because they're mid.
KYLE: (offended) Boomer? I'm not a boomer! I'm a millennial! We invented social media! We survived dial-up internet!
KYLE: We’ve been here since AOL Instant Messenger, okay?
TYSON: Damn, bro. When you wake up in the morning, do you make those beep-beep dial-up noises?
KYLE: Genuinely surprised you know something about AOL, which isn't a lot, but I'll take it.
TYSON: Chill, millennial. You’re gonna be alright. Just let the vibe guide you.
KYLE: (mockingly) “Let the vibe guide you”? That sounds like something you’d say at a bad STUDY class!
TYSON: (to Jazmine) Ayy, you hear that? It’s demon time.
Shark tank walking theme
KYLE: (panicking) What is happening? Did the power go out? Is there a fire drill?
TYSON: Nah, fam, this is just the vibe shift. We’re about to turn up and down. You ready?
KYLE: Turn down for what? Should I be CVERB? Is this a flash mob? Do I need to take out insurance?
KYLE: What is going on right now? This store is a club? I don't remember setting any of this up.
TYSON: Welcome to the future, my dude. This is the new retail experience. It’s giving "multi-sensory RNOUN."
JAZMINE: Ayy, Kyle, don’t be shook. Just hit the dance floor and catch the vibe!
KYLE: No, no, no! I don’t want to catch the vibe! I want to release it! Can I release it? Is that a thing?
KYLE: It sounds like some transmittable disease.
TYSON: Too late, my guy. You’re already in it. Now sleigh that dance floor.
KYLE: (dances) I'll have you know I'm doing this because I like doing nothing on company time.
JAZMINE: Look at him go! My man’s bussin'! No cap!
TYSON: Yo, he’s really out here in his bag! Straight up iconic with the savage mode.

Bluegrass music
BIGEARL: Well, if it ain't Jeb! Good to see ya, son. What can we do for ya today?
BIGEARL: Just a trim or you want the ol' "Business in the Front, Party in the Back" mullet special?
JEB: One of these days, you should have a barber shop that's not in the forest.
BIGEARL: We're in the Appalachian Forest. What did you expect? A building?
JEB: True. But Earl, I was thinkin'. Maybe I could, well, just cut it all off.
BIGEARL: (gasping) Cut it all off? Jeb, have you PVERB your dang mind? Your mullet is the pride of this town!
BIGEARL: Why, it’s shinier than a possum's BODYPART and longer than the line at a free LIQUID stand!
JEB: Oh really? I'd take the compliment more if you didn't know so much about possums.
JEB: Although in these parts, they're easier to find than cousins.
JEB: Speaking of which, I've met someone, and I think they’ll like me better without the mullet.
BIGEARL: Jeb, who in their right mind would want you without a mullet?
BIGEARL: That’s like a animal without fur, or CELEBRITY without a scandal! And they get their BODYPART in all sorts of trouble.
BIGEARL: Your mullet is your thing. You can't just not have a mullet. Are they really that special?
JEB: (sheepish) Uh, well, they’re not exactly your typical date.
BIGEARL: Jeb, don’t tell me you’re finally takin' your shot at RNAME down at the bait shop?
JEB: No, Earl. It’s Sasquatch.
Record scratch
BIGEARL: Oh, good one, Jeb! Woo-ee, you had me goin' there for a second!
JEB: (serious) I ain’t jokin'. I’m takin' Sasquatch out tonight, and I want to look good. You know, sophisticated.
BIGEARL: Sophisticated? I can't pronounce words that big. They make me faint.
BIGEARL: They don’t appreciate a good mullet. They see a mullet, and all they think is, "Oh, here’s a guy who knows how to have fun."
BIGEARL: You cut that off, what do you got? You’re just another guy with a weird head shape.
JEB: But I want to be like them fellas on TV with the fancy haircuts. I reckon Sasquatch will like that.
BIGEARL: Jeb, there’s a lot to unpack here. First, you’re tellin' us you’re datin' the elusive Sasquatch.
BIGEARL: I mean, sure. Hairy things are hot. But you’re goin' on a date with another man?
JEB: Earl, Sasquatch ain't a man, they're an animal!
BIGEARL: But Jeb, what about the number commandments of Mullet Law?
BIGEARL: Rule number one: "Thou shalt not cut off thy mullet, lest you bring shame upon the sacred name of Big Earl’s."
BIGEARL: Rule number two: "Thou shalt always date within thy species."
BIGEARL: And rule number three: "Never, and I mean never, date outside the family tree!"
JEB: Missin' the point! Sasquatch don’t care about mullet laws or species. And besides, they're more than just fur.
JEB: They're not a myth. They're a legend! I’m talkin' 'bout romance in the wilderness, candlelit dinners by a LOCATION.
JEB: Or maybe not over there. May not be stinky enough for their liking. They're real outdoorsy, rugged.
JEB: I just think maybe, if I cut off the mullet, I'll match their vibe better.
BIGEARL: (sighs deeply) Well, Jeb, I gotta say, this here’s a first for us. You sure you wanna go through with it?
JEB: I’m sure. If Sasquatch likes me better without the mullet, then that’s what I gotta do. Cut it all off, Earl.
BIGEARL: (about to cut Jeb's hair) There it goes: Jeb’s mullet. A thing of beauty, gone forever.
BIGEARL: It’s like watchin' the end of CELEBRITY's career. They were amazing before puberty.
Forest footstep
SASQUATCH: (enters from stage right) Stop! What the hell are you doing?
SASQUATCH: Jeb, don’t do it! I don’t care about your hair, I love you just the way you are, mullet and all!
JEB: Sasquatch, you really mean it? By the way, is that cologne you're wearing or is that MUD?
SASQUATCH: (nodding) The best MUD. And absolutely.
SASQUATCH: Besides, I’m the only one in these mountains who could pull off the "no-mullet" look.
JEB: You’d just look like a RNOUN without it.
SASQUATCH: Your'e not really gonna cut that off, are you? I mean, the mullet’s your best feature!
SASQUATCH: I was just tellin’ my buddy MYTHICAL how much I liked it! So much to pull.
BIGEARL: Oh, you know MYTHICAL?
SASQUATCH: Yeah. We hooked up. Had to break up once Netflix made a movie about us.
SASQUATCH: But Jeb's mullet has so much charisma. Keeps my BODYPART warm at night.
JEB: I had no idea!
SASQUATCH: I want your mullet to stay, my love.
JEB: (kisses Sasquatch) Oh yes I will!
BIGEARL: That settles that then. Knew it should stay. But hey, what do I know?
BIGEARL: I'm just the guy who’s been cuttin’ mullets since before I met your RELATIVE.
BIGEARL: And they told me I had to earn a living nine months later.
BIGEARL: So, you and Sasquatch are a thing. Guess I'm cool with it.
SASQUATCH: You better be or I'll eat you.
BIGEARL: Plus, Sasquatch is one heck of a wingman for huntin’ season!
SASQUATCH: Remember I'm non-binary.
BIGEARL: Big ol' wingthing. And remember, Jeb! The “Party in the Back” special is always waitin' for ya.

WIFE: Oh, Harold, isn’t this place just darling? Look at that view! The mountains, the mist. Oh, look at that!
HUSBAND: That's just a photo framed on the wall of our hotel room.
WIFE: Oh okay.
HUSBAND: But what's with all the wood in here? It’s like they chopped down the whole NATURE just for this room.
HUSBAND: And what’s that smell? Pine? Cedar? Are we living in a Christmas tree?
WIFE: That's the cologne you found in a CONTAINER.
HUSBAND: (spots something on floor by front door) What are those? Did someone leave doll clothes here?
WIFE: (gasping) Harold, you uncultured swine! It's shoes.
HUSBAND: Not for us, right?
WIFE: I suspect it’s some kind of local custom. You know, like a hospitality thing. Maybe we’re supposed to wear them?
HUSBAND: Wear them? Are you kidding me? These things couldn't fit on my pinky BODYPART!
HUSBAND: Who's wearing these? A SMANIMAL?
WIFE: Come on, Harold, it’s probably a sign of FNOUN or something.
WIFE: You’re always saying we should be more open to new experiences.
HUSBAND: I said new experiences, not foot-binding.
WIFE: (checks phone) I'm reading about these things online on WEBSITE dot com.
WIFE: Tiny shoes, big respect. It’s a sign of humility to the gods of COUNTRY.
HUSBAND: COUNTRY. Say that three times fast.
WIFE: No! You know how I develop MCONDITION from excessive tongue-twisters.
HUSBAND: These tiny shoes, though. They look like they belong on a Christmas ornament.
WIFE: Or a SMANIMAL that has some bragging rights. It’s symbolic.
WIFE: Just try them on. What’s the worst that could happen?
HUSBAND: Oh, I don’t know, maybe I lose circulation in my BODYPART, fall over, crack my head open.
HUSBAND: Real fun vacation watching me suffer like someone who might secretly like pain.
HUSBAND: These can't be for adults. There’s no way. They must’ve gotten the wrong size. This is insane!
WIFE: Just put them on, Harold!
HUSBAND: (puts on shoes) Oh, yeah. This is great. Real comfortable. I’m loving this.
WIFE: You look ridiculous, Larry.
HUSBAND: Oh, do I? Because I feel ridiculous too. My toes are folded up like EFOLD in here.
HUSBAND: Yeah, this is a great idea, honey. Really embracing the local culture here.
HUSBAND: I'm embracing it so much I might need a MDEVICE for the rest of the trip.
EMPLOYEE: (enters through front door) Ah, Mr. Harold, welcome to COUNTRY! I see you have found the traditional shoes.
HUSBAND: (sarcastic) I see knocking is not a formality in our country.
WIFE: Yes, Harold's wearing the tiny shoes right now. We thought it was a local custom.
HUSBAND: Yeah, apparently it's a custom to torture your guests. Not the good kind of torture.
EMPLOYEE: (laughing) Oh no, no! The shoes are just for decoration! They are to bring good luck to your stay.
EMPLOYEE: No one wears them. They are very sacred and very small!
WIFE: They're decorative?
EMPLOYEE: Yes, they are meant to stay outside the door.
EMPLOYEE: They symbolize the small steps of good RNOUN coming into your life.
HUSBAND: Small steps? My feet are taking no steps! They’re crammed into these death traps you call shoes!
WIFE: Oh my God, Harold, you have no good RNOUN at all! Take them off right now!
HUSBAND: I'm trying! They’re like Chinese finger traps!
WIFE: That's racist, honey.
HUSBAND: I love you, but I can't even right now.
EMPLOYEE: You know, you’re not the first one to make this mistake.
EMPLOYEE: Last year, CELEBRITY tried to wear them as a fashion statement. We had to cut off their feet.
HUSBAND: What did you just say?
EMPLOYEE: We had to cut them off their feet. They still contracted MCONDITION, though.
HUSBAND: (horrified) Cut them off? What kind of twisted tradition is this?
EMPLOYEE: Do not worry, Mr. Harold. You have brought much laughter to COUNTRY. We will remember you fondly.
HUSBAND: Oh, fantastic. I’m a laughingstock in a foreign country. This trip just keeps getting better and better.
EMPLOYEE: You have made your mark on COUNTRY! We will feature you in our next tourism billboard.
HUSBAND: (sarcastic) Oh, wonderful. Just what I needed!
EMPLOYEE: Don’t worry! We will send you a free pair of tiny shoes as a souvenir. In your size next time!
WIFE: You know, Harold, maybe next time, we should just stick to postcards.
HUSBAND: Or at least read the fine print on the customs before I end up on a billboard in a foreign language.

RICH: Alright, listen up, dingbats! We’ve gotta AVERB our productivity before the entire SPACE collapses into a singularity of mediocrity!
RICH: We’re behind by, like, NUMBER units of something, I don’t know.
MARTIN: Rich, are you sure this meeting is really necessary?
MARTIN: I mean, can’t we just, like, fix things by, I don’t know, not messing up in the first place?
SHANE: Oh, please. This is all just a colossal waste of time. I could be out hunting for some FAKEDRUG right now.
SHANE: But nooo, I’m stuck here listening to Rich rant about productivity like it’' gonna stop the next apocalypse.
JERRY: I don’t even work here. Why am I in this meeting? And what exactly are we producing? Widgets? Cosmic chaos? Tacos?
RICH: Shut up, Jerry. Your mere presence is statistically lowering the IQ of this room. Or maybe you make everyone seem smarter.
RICH: Okay, everyone, focus. We need to AVERB productivity across NUMBER locations.
RICH: If we don’t, we’re looking at a catastrophic collapse of the SMOBJECT market, and I am not dealing with that hangover again!
MARTIN: We’ve tried everything! I mean, you even created that, uh, INVENTION thing last time.
MARTIN: And all it did was, uh, implode the office and turn everyone into, like, gelatinous CREATUREs for a week!
SHANE: Yeah, and I’ve got news for you, Rick. Most of us actually enjoyed being gelatinous CREATUREs. It was kinda chill.
JERRY: Wait, is that why I’ve been feeling so squishy?
RICH: Listen, Martin! You don’t get it, do you? We’re operating on a whole other level here!
RICH: This is about maximizing efficiency on a SADJECTIVE scale! We need ideas, and we need them now! Or else.
MARTIN: Fine, whatever! I’ve got just the thing! Behold, the INVENTION.
RICH: I already invented that. You just slapped your name on it.
MARTIN: This is a game-changing device that’ll take you from zero to infinite productivity in, like, NUMBER minutes.
RICH: (sarcastically) Oh great, another jackass with a glowing doohickey. Just what we needed.
RICH: You got any idea how many of these "game-changers" I’ve seen blow up in people’s faces?
RICH: I bet you didn’t even test it in an RNOUN vacuum, did ya?
SHANE: There is too much suction if he tested it in an RNOUN vacuum.
SHANE: Ugh, this is gonna be another one of those "fix it with some SMOBJECT” deals, isn’t it?
SHANE: Just tell me when it’s over so I can go do something actually fun, like stealing from a rich orphan.
MARTIN: Rich, I don’t know if we should mess with the glowing doohickey.
MARTIN: Remember the last time you borrowed a INVENTION from mom? It didn't end well.
JERRY: Can I try it? Maybe it'll finally help me understand what’s going on here.
RICH: Hands off, Jerry! You wanna trigger a war with one-eyed CREATUREs? Be my guest! Just do it far away from me, alright?
RICH: Actually, I'm sure the INVENTION is totally safe. I’ve only used it, like, once before, and it only erased time and space.
RICH: Now, who’s ready to crank up the productivity to, like, 11? Here it goes!

MARTIN: What the hell did you do this time?
RICH: Nothing, Martin! Let this be an important lesson to all of you. We don't need INVENTION to increase productivity.
MARTIN: But everyone outside the building is now a gelatinous CREATURE, and they're hideous!
RICH: Productivity has been inside us this entire time, just like the trackers I put inside everyone's BODYPART.
SHANE: I don't remember you doing that. That explains the itching.
RICH: Exactly.
SHANE: You know, I kinda like being productive. It's like doing nothing, but the FAKEDRUGS help me realize I can do something.
JERRY: Is this real? Are we being productive? Somebody tell me if I'm being productive!
RICH: Oh, it’s real, Jerry. Real as that empty void where your BODYPART's supposed to be.
JERRY: That explains the numbness.
RICH: Welcome to the nightmare of us accidentally triggering a sense of fertility, buddy. You happy now?

MICK: I'd screwed up the first part of the exam when I had to resort to the interrogation manual.
MICK: In frustration, my boss went out looking for the TALK-atron 5000, a machine that can make anyone confess.
MICK: He told me that if I could get a confession before he got back, I'd pass.
MICK: My name is Mick Sturbs, and this is what happened.

DEREK: Yeah, well, he's got it in for me ever since what happened TEN YEARs ago between me and him.

DEREK: My kids can't grow up without a dad, and my wife can't bring up two boys on her own.
MICK: Yes, that would be unfair on them, I agree.
DEREK: So how about we make a deal? If you write me a note saying I'm immune from all prosecution, I'll tell you who stole the MONEY.

SCRIPT ==========================================
Noir music 4
SAMSHADY: The city was darker than a black cat in an unlit coal mine.
SAMSHADY: Or perhaps darker than a goth kid's poetry journal after someone taught them how to smile.
SAMSHADY: Darker than a Hollywood reboot produced by the makers of BADMOVIE.
SAMSHADY: Tonight, trouble had a name. Mitch.
Knocking on door
SAMSHADY: Come in, if you're not selling extended LOBJECT warranties!
MITCH: Sammy, my man! You called?
SAMSHADY: Mitch. Thanks for coming in. Excuse the phrasing. Sit down. There's something I've gotta ask you.
MITCH: Oh, sure. But I have to leave soon. I’ve got a LESSON class in thirty minutes.
SAMSHADY: LESSON, huh? Strange. I never knew you took LESSON.
MITCH: Yeah, it’s great for the core. Plus, the instructor's name is Bruno, and let me tell ya, that guy can bend like a pipe OCCUPATION.
SAMSHADY: Pipe OCCUPATION, you say? That's quite the analogy.
MITCH: I suppose so!
SAMSHADY: But why pipes?
MITCH: It's a word that came to mind.
SAMSHADY: So his name is Bruno, you say? Sounds European.
MITCH: No, he's from CITY.
SAMSHADY: CITY is not a place where a lot of "pipe OCCUPATIONs" can be found.
MITCH: I'll take your word for it.
SAMSHADY: Mitch, we've been friends a long time. We've had some good times.
SAMSHADY: Remember that time in Cabo when you told the bartender you preferred "fruity cocktails" and what was it?
SAMSHADY: "COBJECT make everything better."
MITCH: COBJECTs make the drink sparkle.
SAMSHADY: You said "sparkle." Now you have my curiosity.
MITCH: (laughs) It’s true! What’s a drink without a little flair?
SAMSHADY: And remember last month, when you said, and I quote, “There’s nothing like a good musical to really get your blood pumping.”
MITCH: Absolutely. You ever seen BROADWAY? Mind-blowing choreography.
SAMSHADY: Most people hate BROADWAY, but a certain segment of our population likes the choreography.
SAMSHADY: Interesting. Very interesting. Say, Mitch, what’s your take on CELEBRITY in a well-fitted suit?
SAMSHADY: Hypothetically speaking, of course.
MITCH: Hypothetically? A national treasure. That man’s a walking masterpiece of masculinity and tweed.
SAMSHADY: Mitch, let’s say, just for argument’s sake, that you’re at a party. You see two doors.
SAMSHADY: One leads to a room full of gorgeous women.
SAMSHADY: The other is a room full of tastefully shirtless male fitness models, oil optional. Which door do you walk through?
MITCH: Well, that depends. What’s the lighting like in the male model room?
SAMSHADY: Aha! I knew it!
MITCH: Sam, what’s going on? You’ve been acting weird lately. Are you trying to ask me something? If so, just spill it.
SAMSHADY: Alright, Mitch, I’ll lay it on the line. I’ve been following you around, taking notes.
SAMSHADY: You’re sending signals, buddy. Mixed ones. Like a radio stuck between two stations.
SAMSHADY: I gotta know. Are you a fan of musicals, fruit salad and RNOUN?
MITCH: Yeah. But RNOUN. Really? Sam, are you trying to figure out if I'm gay?
MITCH: Sammy, come on! Just because I like yoga, fruity drinks, musicals, and CELEBRITY doesn’t mean I’m gay!
MITCH: It just means I have good taste!
SAMSHADY: So you’re not?
MITCH: Oh Heavens to Betsy, no. But thanks for the concern. But I was wondering if you’d want to grab dinner with me Friday night?
MITCH: There's a new FOOD place the girls and I have been dying to try.
SAMSHADY: Sure, Mitch! It's a date! (realization) Wait a minute.
MITCH: Case closed, Sammy. Case closed.
SAMSHADY: It was a case I’ll never forget. In the end, it turns out Mitch wasn’t hiding anything, but maybe I was.
SAMSHADY: Like the fact that I’m terrible at reading between the lines. Or that I kinda like musicals and RNOUN too.

CUSTOMER: (enters from stage right) Can anyone help me, please? Anyone at all?
CLERK: (sarcastic) Fantastic. Let me just restock my murderous intent on the shelf over here.
CLERK: (to customer) Welcome! How may I assist you today?
CUSTOMER: Why yes. I pressed a bunch of buttons on my APPLIANCE and it made funny noise.
CUSTOMER: It do things and it not working anymore. Please help. I need service. I need refund.
CLERK: Okay, so what I'm gathering is you did things to your APPLIANCE and now it's not working.
CUSTOMER: Yes. I have the paperwork right here.
CLERK: There is nothing written on it. It's completely blank.
CLERK: Well, when I flip the paper to the other side, I see a drawing of a SMOBJECT. Why?
CUSTOMER: It's what I put in it, and then light go blink-blink before it stop.
CLERK: Why would you put a SMOBJECT in there?
CUSTOMER: To spice things up, I guess.
CLERK: That's probably what caused your unit to stop working.
CUSTOMER: Um. Maybe.
CLERK: Can you explain to me what you did specifically before the APPLIANCE stopped working?
CUSTOMER: It's worked until I press a button and it say, "I don't like you touching me like that."
CLERK: You heard the APPLIANCE speak to you and say those exact words?
CUSTOMER: I don't know. Maybe it liked being touched.
CLERK: (exasperated) Okay, how about this? Do you have a receipt or an invoice so I can check your warranty status?
CLERK: I mean we can absolutely come out there for a service call and check out what's wrong.
CUSTOMER: I know the issue.
CLERK: Okay?
CUSTOMER: I ACTVERB it and it make shaky-shake. It needed smoke later.
CLERK: So, I'm going to ignore what you just said and look up your invoice on my COMPUTER here.
CUSTOMER: Oh. You keep paperwork on there? I like that. How do you get paper out?
CLERK: Magic. Dark magic. Presto! Change-o! SILLYWORD!
CUSTOMER: Don't say that. I feel cursed now.
CLERK: Oof. Looks like the warranty expired NUMBER years ago. Our warranty is for one year.
CUSTOMER: No, I bought it here at store.
CLERK: That's been established.
CUSTOMER: Oh, okay. So I can have money now?
CLERK: You don't qualify for a refund or a subout since you purchased your unit over a year ago.
CUSTOMER: But you sold me machine that make whirring, buzzing, like click-click-click. Then a big bang.
CLERK: After you ACTVERB it?
CUSTOMER: No, but after that, they want to see other people. Now it make a noise like CREATURE.
CLERK: Can you make that noise for me?
CUSTOMER: Error 404 Not Found.
CLERK: So you think a CREATURE would chirp, "Error 404 Not Found"?
CUSTOMER: Yes. I wrote it down on the paperwork.
CLERK: It's still a blank piece of paper with an SMOBJECT on it. Have you tried unplugging it?
CUSTOMER: When I do that, it stops working.
CLERK: When you unplug something, that’s like, the ultimate "off." That’s the nuclear option of turning off.
CLERK: If it stops making noises when you unplug it, that means it was functioning correctly.
CUSTOMER: I don't believe you. I think you hide something.
CLERK: What could you possibly think that I would be hiding from you?
CUSTOMER: That thing on your shelf.
CLERK: My murderous intent?
CUSTOMER: No. The LGNOUN next to it.
CLERK: That could be used for murdering annoying customers.
CUSTOMER: That may help fix the problem.
CLERK: Or it could fix my problem right here.
CUSTOMER: Oh. Okay. I bought a new APPLIANCE yesterday and it working now. Thank you.

(waltz music)
DAUGHTER: (pacing back on forth searching the room) Ah, where is it? Oh dear, where have I misplaced it this time?!
MOTHER: Looking for something are you, Elizabeth?
DAUGHTER: I'm just looking for my JEWELLERY, mother. Have you seen it anywhere? I can't seem to find it at all.
MOTHER: Is this what you're looking for? (holds up the jewellery)
DAUGHTER: Ah yes! That's exactly the one! Thank you, mother. (takes it from her)
MOTHER: Planning on going somewhere, Elizabeth?
DAUGHTER: (happy tone) Yes, mother. I've been invited to attend Lady Isabelle's tea party this evening. I'll be back before 9 pm.
MOTHER: I see....
DAUGHTER: (walk towards the door) I best leave now, mother. Lady Isabelle would be quite displeased if I were to be late.
MOTHER: Are you sure you're going to be attending Lady Isabelle's tea party?
(music stops)
MOTHER: Or were you leaving to meet someone else?
(piano theme)
(mystery music 1)
DAUGHTER: (turns around) I-I don't know what you speak of, mother. Where else would i have gone to?
MOTHER: It's not where else you would've gone to, but more so who else you would've gone to.
DAUGHTER: I don't know what you're implying, mother.
MOTHER: Oh, don't play the dim girl with me, Elizabeth.
MOTHER: You only wear that JEWELLERY, for the utmost important occasions or....
MOTHER: When there is someone you're trying to impress.
DAUGHTER: I.....
MOTHER: And i'm quite sure something so simple like a mediocre tea party has by far the littlest importance to you.
MOTHER: So out with it, who were you really eager to meet at this time?
DAUGHTER: (mumbles) sir.....
MOTHER: Hm, what was that? Speak up, now.
DAUGHTER:.... sir NAME1.
MOTHER: .....Are you kidding me? Really. Sir NAME1? And why would he ask you to sneak around and about at this hour?
DAUGHTER: He approached me two weeks ago. He wanted to speak with me...regarding a proposal.
MOTHER: I should've known.
DAUGHTER: Mother, I....
MOTHER: I've seen the way you look at him. The way your eyes followed him at last year's CELEBRATION ball.
DAUGHTER: I do not understand why you detest him so.
MOTHER: Really now. Was it not him who nearly drove his family into poverty due to his enormous purchase of ITEMS?
DAUGHTER: Mother....
MOTHER: And was it not him who tarnished my best friend lady NAME2's reputation so much that it drove her to reside in the countryside?!
DAUGHTER: (reaches out) Mother I.....
MOTHER: And was he not the one who was caught doing a shady transaction with that suspicious JOB just last week?!
DAUGHTER: (walks towards mother and raises voice) Mother, I LOVE HIM!
(music stops)
(church bell)
MOTHER:...You what?
DAUGHTER: I....love him, mother. Even if we haven't spoken much yet.
(lacrimosa music)
MOTHER: Elizabeth. He is nothing but a troublemaker. Cavorting about with him will only bring your status and reputation down.
MOTHER: So this whole meet-up and talk about love is absolutely out of the question.
MOTHER: I forbid you from meeting him.
DAUGHTER: But, mother!
MOTHER: You are not to speak to him, not to look at him, let alone even think about him.
DAUGHTER: You can't do this to me! It is not fair! Why do I have to suffer just because father passed?!
MOTHER: (raises voice) I am your mother. Elizabeth. This has nothing to do with your father, I am merely trying to protect you.
DAUGHTER: But...
MOTHER: I do not want to talk about this matter any further. If you go against my word, you will face serious consequences.
DAUGHTER: This is so unfair!
(music stops)
(doorbell)
(waltz music)
DAUGHTER: (opens door) Sir NAME1! W-why are you here?
LOVER: I was waiting at the PLACE, but when you didn't show, I just had to come here myself.
LOVER: I couldn't wait any longer. I really, really needed to ask you this.
LOVER: Elizabeth, will you....
DAUGHTER: YES! Yes! A thousand times yes!
LOVER: R-Really? That's so good to hear!
LOVER: I can't believe i'm finally going to be able to do this. I've waited for so long...
DAUGHTER: I have too! I...
LOVER: (walks past her and walks towards her mother) Lady NAME3.
LOVER: (holds out his hand) Will you marry me?
(music stops)
(record scratch)
DAUGHTER: ....WHAT?!
Meanwhile MOTHER: ....WHAT?!
(sad chug jug music)
DAUGHTER: B-But I don't understand sir NAME1! You wanted to ask me about a proposal!
LOVER: (turns and looks at the daughter) Precisely. I wanted to ask a proposal to you...to allow me to court your mother.
DAUGHTER: B-but...
MOTHER: This was...unexpected. However, i'm afraid I can't return the feelings that you feel for me.
LOVER: My lady...why is that?
MOTHER: You nearly sent your family into debt, you destroyed my best friend's reputation...
MOTHER: Not to mention you were just caught making a shady deal with that suspicious JOB just a fortnight ago!
MOTHER: You are nothing but a troublemaker.
(emotional piano music)
LOVER: My lady.... the reason I bought all those ITEMS.....was so I could send them to you.
LOVER: I found out that they were your favourite, so I tried to buy every single one I could.
LOVER: As for Lady NAME2...I found out she was speaking ill of you to several other ladies.
LOVER: And I could not sit back and watch as she tried to tarnish the reputation of the woman who I love.
LOVER: So I just did the same to her.
MOTHER: B-But that doesn't explain that transaction you made!
LOVER: (gentle chuckle) hahaha... you see my lady, the reason I made a deal with that suspicious JOB... was for this.
LOVER: (gets down on one knee and pulls out a ring) I had this specially made just for you. Made from pure ROCK which was hard to get.
LOVER: So yes, I went through all that trouble. But for the woman I love.....I would do it over and over again.
(aww)
DAUGHTER: ....I-I'm sorry, sir NAME1. But my mother would never love a man like you. She detests you beyond oblivion.
MOTHER: Now hold on, Elizabeth.
MOTHER: Sir NAME1. It is true that I detested you. After hearing all of your absurd deeds, I was sure you were a man who cared for no one but himself.
MOTHER: But.....I was wrong.
MOTHER: After my previous husband passed....I was certain I couldn't find love nor would anyone love me again. But everything's changed now...
MOTHER:...nobody has done what you have for me. It has moved me...
MOTHER: (gentle and happy tone) But I can say for certain now....I love you, sir NAME1. And yes, I will marry you.
DAUGHTER: W-What?! This is ridiculous! (runs out of the room)
LOVER: Well, after you my lady...or should I say...my NICKNAME?
MOTHER: (gentle chuckle) Thank you....my love. (exits through the front door)
LOVER: hahaha...the pleasure is all mine. (exits through front door as well)
TYPEWRITER: And so....the ice around Lady NAME3's heart melted. The two soon got married after much to Elizabeth's dismay.
TYPEWRITER: Much to no surprise, elizabeth's faith in love died after that entire debacle.
TYPEWRITER: Nevertheless....
TYPEWRITER: Love truly conquers all, doesn't it?.....

HOST: Welcome back, everyone, to "Cooking for PERSON."
HOST: I'm Mr. Host, and here with me are a duo of Michelin Star chefs, who have come all the way from PLACE.
HOST: Tonight, they'll be showing us their famous Tortilla Pizza recipe!
CHEF 1: (To host) Thank you for having us.
CHEF 1: (To audience) Now, we want to start off by preheating the oven to an ideal NUMBER degrees.
CHEF 2: While that's heating, we'll gather our ingredients.
CHEF 2: Here, we have tortilla shells, mozzarella cheese, EDIBLE, hearty marinara sauce...
CHEF 2: ...Italian seasoning, and of course, SOLID.
HOST: What a unique blend of flavors. I've never seen mozzarella and SOLID used in the same recipe before.
CHEF 1: We both take much pride in the culture of our home in PLACE.
CHEF 1: We feel it's a necessity to share our history with the world through our cooking.
CHEF 2: We'll have to cook this EDIBLE on the stovetop first.
CHEF 2: We're going to prepare the pan by pouring some LIQUID right in the center, and just let it spread around.
HOST: Goodness, the smell is wonderful! May I add the EDIBLE?
CHEF 2: Of course! Just be careful. The LIQUID simmers quickly, and it may spatter.
CHEF 1: Meanwhile, I'm going to lay this tortilla out, and we're going to use a TOOL to evenly spread the ingredients. Sauce, cheese...
HOST: Looks like the EDIBLE is done cooking!
CHEF 2: (Rushed) Yup yup, add that on top while it's still hot.
CHEF 1: Sprinkle the seasoning, and then we spread SOLID on TOP of it! (Place in oven).
HOST: To make it melt through! Clever! How long do we keep it in the oven now?
CHEF 1: Until the tortilla crisps and turns COLOR.
CHEF 2: There's that COLOR! Let's take it out of the oven now... (Take out of oven).
HOST: Wow, that looks sensational. I feel it's only fair for the chefs to take the first bite.
CHEF 1: No no, we insist. You are about to enjoy a delicacy of PLACE.
HOST: (Take a bite). Oh, heaven, it's delicious! You can really taste the kick of that EDIBLE, and the texture of that melted SOLID.

BOSS: Umm... I think that's just VR Chat.
OLD EMPLOYEE: What an amateur! That's just like my idea about a new spin on GAME. So you're stealing ideas from me now huh?

NEW EMPLOYEE: Not just the SUBCULTURE but also anyone who likes to act and have fun in plays too!
OLD EMPLOYEE: You forgot one important thing, newbie.
OLD EMPLOYEE: Who's gonna write the scripts?
NEW EMPLOYEE: Well will at the beginning. We can start with around NUMBER.
NEW EMPLOYEE: But if the game gets big enough we can have the players write the scripts!
OLD EMPLOYEE: Are you nuts!? That sounds dangerous! The players can't be trusted to do that!
OLD EMPLOYEE: They'll probably write some weird story about SOMETHING. This is a ADJECTIVE idea!
BOSS: Calm down, NICKNAME I think we actually may have something here.
OLD EMPLOYEE: We absolutely do not! It don't sound fun! It's a game where you just watch other people play most of the time!
OLD EMPLOYEE: And then we make them do our job by having them write more scripts?
OLD EMPLOYEE: The SUBCULTURE won't go for that!
BOSS: I disagree. I think we should try it! (Look at newbie) You got a name for this game?
NEW EMPLOYEE: Well, not really but maybe we can call it... (thinks) oh! I know! How about NE AA NAME?
(Shark Tank Offer)
BOSS: I like it, but perhaps BO AA NAME could work as well.

OLD EMPLOYEE: Unbelievable! This is a bad idea, boss! It's boring. No one will play it!
OLD EMPLOYEE: You're really gonna go with this... this... ADJECTIVE concept!?
NEW EMPLOYEE: You said that already.
OLD EMPLOYEE: Well there's no other way to describe it!
OLD EMPLOYEE: It's just anarchy with an audience! I don't know if we can make a standalone game out of that idea!

SCRIPT ==========================================
(noir music 1)
Detective: (Looks at the audience) It was a Friday night and I have been spending six months…
Detective: Trying to find the notorious great kidnapper but alas,I have no idea.
Detective: (Looks at the case board) Who is it and where is this kidnapper hiding?
Detective: (Facepalms) Every lead I've ever had has gone to a dead end.
Detective: (Sits down) They have kidnapped NUMBER children so far, maybe even more.
Detective: (Frustrated) I need answers, it should be right in front of my face!
Detective: Luckily, I sent my partner out to dig up some dirt.
Detective: My partner should be back soon with it and hopefully with my NOUN7.
Partner: (Enter the room and walk up to the detective) I'm back and I am sorry it took so long.
(music stops)
(noir music 2)
Partner: Here's your NOUN7, NOUN1.
Detective: Thank you NOUN2, my good partner. Got any leads?
Partner: Well I did see a person with a ADJECTIVE look on their face.
Partner: They were at NOUN6 earlier today.
Detective: Good work my partner, with a little luck we’ll see if they’re who we’re looking for.
Detective: (Stands up and looks out the window) After all, I've been hunting down the kidnapper ever since the day I moved from Los Angeles to NOUN5.
Detective: (Sits down and slams fist on desk) We're gonna find them even if it kills me!
Detective: I need you to go out and find me more clues NOUN2.
Detective: Maybe some sort of clue like NOUN4 could help us.
Detective: Or maybe NOUN8 dropped something while being kidnapped.
(music stops)
(mystery music 1)
Detective: (Angry) This kidnapping bastard really grinds my gears!
Detective: But now after six long months we finally got one small potential lead.
Detective: Alright, partner. Head back on out and see what you can find.
Partner: I will sir, I hope we can get even closer to solving this. (Walks out the door and leaves it open)
(music stops)
(noir music 3)
Detective: Now that I have the office to myself, I should try and reference the description my partner found.
Detective: There’s got to be something I’m missing, but what?
(music stops)
(dark classical music)
Kidnapper: (Enters stage left) Ahem.
(thunder)
Detective: (Gasps in shock) Wait a minute who are you? And How'd you get into my office!?
Kidnapper: Well as you can see, the door was left wide open assuming the person passed me did that.
Detective: (Angrily) That person is my partner and I’ve told my partner many times to lock the damn door!
Kidnapper: Ah yes, That must be the person I passed on my way here.
Kidnapper: Between the two of you, your partner certainly doesn’t seem to be the brighter one.
Partner: (Walks into the office and is in shock) Uhh, my bad, I left the door open, I completely forgot.
Detective: (Annoyed) Well, too late for that now!
Detective: Because somebody just walked in and I have no idea who!
Kidnapper: Sorry for wandering on into here, I got lost and decided to check out the open door.
Detective: That’s great and all but I’m gonna have to ask that you leave.
Detective: I have a very important case to solve.
Kidnapper: Well, maybe I can help. What are you trying to solve?
Detective: (Looks seriously at the stranger) It's a kidnapping case.
Kidnapper: Got any evidence or leads so far?
Detective: All the evidence I've collected over the six months.
Partner: The evidence that I uncovered for my boss to analyze.
Detective: That all led to dead ends! Hopefully your recent contribution will shed some light…
Kidnapper: Oh, well I might have a few insights.
Detective: Do tell.
Kidnapper: For one, maybe those kids really did need a nap. They've been staying up too late and getting cranky.
Detective: (Laughs) Yes, yes… real funny. But this is serious!
Detective: (Shows the stranger the pictures) NOUN8 was playing at a nearby playground.
Kidnapper: Ah the playground, certainly a joyous place for that kid to have fun.
Kidnapper: Truly a shame that it was apparently ruined.
Detective: Indeed… but as you can see right here, we got a good shot of the likely suspect.
Detective: And I had an expert get a nice closeup and enhancement of the face…
Detective: That oh so familiar ADJECTIVE face…
Detective: (Point at the kidnapper) Your Face!
Meanwhile Kidnapper: (Gasp)
Kidnapper: Did you know it was me the whole time? Guess the jig is up
Kidnapper: Okay fine, it was I that kidnapped all those children.
Detective: (Points at the kidnapper) (Smirks) I knew it!
Detective: As a great detective the answer is always right in front of me.
Detective: As you can see I looked over the picture that my partner took outside of NOUN6.
Kidnapper: Well… I mean I have to admit it was a good angle for me in those shots.
Detective: Uh… okay? Anyway It was all too simple to recognize that ADJECTIVE look on your face.
Detective: (laugh triumphantly) And deduce it was you who kidnapped NUMBER children to your secret home!
Detective: So my dubious kidnapper, what is your name?
Kidnapper: My name is NOUN3, but don’t sound too confident just because you found me out!
(music stops)
(happy music 1)
Kidnapper: (Punch the detective in the face once) Take that!
Meanwhile DETECTIVE: (Take no damage from the attack)
Kidnapper: (Shocked) How are you still standing?
Detective: Thanks for the massage, but next time, use a little more pressure.
Detective: As I am a great detective, I'm always prepared for anything!
Detective: Even if a criminal foolishly enough to fight back.
Kidnapper: Go to hell you stupid detective!
Kidnapper: You may be smart enough to solve cases, but you can’t be that strong!
Detective: And seeing that you just screwed up trying to pull a punch on me, You’re gonna regret it!
Detective: (Punch’s the kidnapper in the gut) You better learn to never try that again!
Meanwhile Kidnapper: (Hunch over from punch and start shaking in fear)
Kidnapper: Ok, I never knew detectives could be so strong.
Detective: With this, the case is now closed.
Detective: My partner, I need you to turn NOUN3 to the police.
Partner: Yes NOUN1, i’ll make sure NOUN3 gets in their custody.
Kidnapper: I can’t believe you caught me! But I will escape one day and kidnap more children when I do!
Partner: You're coming with me, so move it before I smack you!
Partner: (Grabs the kidnapper and drags him out the door)
Meanwhile Kidnapper: (Screams in anger) (Get dragged off stage)
Detective: (Sighs with relief) After six months,I finally caught them!
Detective: (Stands up and looks out the window) I wonder what may the next case be that awaits me?
Detective: They can run, they can hide, but the truth always catches up.

CHARLES: Mmm-hmm. Very “convincing,” Beverly. But I bet it all went wrong with the last one, didn’t it? That’s why you got sloppy.
CHARLES: Couldn't cover it up. Did they discover the SMOBJECT in the basement?
CHARLES: Or maybe the authorities got suspicious when they found that note from your associate, FNAME, telling you to “finish the job”?
BEVERLY: There was no job to finish! What, in the world, is going on here?
OFFICER: (enters from stage right): Beverly FNAME, you’re under arrest.
BEVERLY: What? For murder? I didn't murder anyone! I just told you!
OFFICER: No, no, not for murder. For ACRIME.
BEVERLY: Oh. Well, yeah. I did do that. Guilty as charged.
CHARLES: Well, folks, justice has finally been served. It’s not the murder spree we were expecting, but clearly, she had something to hide all along.
CHARLES: Join us next time on Breaking Winds News, where we get to the truth, as accurately told on the Internet.
OFFICER: Hold on a second, Charles.
CHARLES: Uh, yes, Officer?
OFFICER: Just curious. How long have you been reporting here at Breaking Winds News?
CHARLES: Oh, uh, a long time! Years. Decades even! Why do you ask?
OFFICER: Well, you sure seem to know a lot about how people might, you know, hide bodies.
CHARLES: W-What? What are you implying?
OFFICER: I’m not implying anything. I’m just saying, you were very specific. Giant BODYPART, basements, notes from mysterious associates.
OFFICER: Got me thinking. You ever, uh, buried anything yourself?
CHARLES: No! No, of course not! I’m just, uh, doing my job, you know, asking the tough questions! You can't prove anything!
OFFICER: Whoa, whoa, Charles, relax. I’m not accusing you of murder. Just making conversation.
CHARLES: I have to go. You know, news things. Important breaking news! Out the window! (exits stage)
Crashing debris

DOC: Hello. Please take a seat and tell me what brings you here.
Meanwhile PAT: (Sits down on the stool)
PAT: Uhm... doctor, I've recently started to feel burning pain in my PART.
DOC: In your PART? That's curious. How long has that been going on?
PAT: It's been almost DURATION now.
DOC: I see. Has anything unusual happened to your PART during that time?
PAT: Well, not really. In fact I barely even touched my PART during that DURATION.
DOC: What about food? Have you changed your diet recently?
PAT: Yes, actually, I've embraced a new lifestyle. Me and my MEMBER, we're only eating FOOD now.
DOC: Really? Just FOOD?
PAT: Yes. I've read on NETWORK that eating only FOOD is really good for your ORGAN.
DOC: Well, apparently it wasn't good for your PART. And what about your MEMBER? Do they have problems with their PART too?
PAT: No, it's just me.
DOC: Alright, let's take a look at it. Please, sit over there. (Points at the examination table)
PAT: Uhm... Doctor NAME... I'm not very comfortable with showing people my PART.
DOC: Don't worry, I'm a professional. I've seen so much PART that it's just work for me at this point.
PAT: Okay... (Sits on the examination table, shows PART)
DOC: Oh my, I've never seen a PART this swollen in my entire career as a PROF. You have a rare case of SYNDROME.
PAT: Really? Oh god, doctor NAME, what should I do?
DOC: Well, I'm not gonna lie, that's not gonna be a quick and painless recovery, but if you rub SUBSTANCE into your PART twice a day you will get better.
PAT: SUBSTANCE? How am I supposed to go to work with SUBSTANCE on my PART?
DOC: I'm sure you'll think of something. Unfortunately for you it's either this or no PART at all.
PAT: I understand, doctor NAME... I'll do whatever it takes to save my PART. I might even have to take a break from ACTIVITY for a while.
DOC: Yes, I would also advise you to stop eating FOOD and see if it helps.
PAT: Hmm, can I at least rub FOOD into my PART? Do you think it will help?
DOC: Oh, I doubt that. Just stick to SUBSTANCE for now. It contains lots of CHEMICAL which your PART desperately needs right now.
PAT: I heard that FOOD is also a good source of CHEMICAL.
DOC: I think you should also stop reading NETWORK for now. There's a lot of misinformation there.
PAT: (Sighs) Okay, if you say so... You are the best PROF I know, so I trust your judgement.
DOC: Good. You can put your PART away now. (Turns back to the desk) Here is a SUBSTANCE receipt for you, and that's gonna be it for today.
PAT: You're a lifesaver! (Takes the receipt and walks towards the door)
PAT: I guess, I'll go home and tell my MEMBER that I have SYNDROME now and that ACTIVITY will have to wait...
PAT: And no more FOOD in the house...
DOC: Yes. Come back for a check up in one week and we'll take another look at your PART. Take care!
PAT: Thanks, doctor NAME! (Exits the office)
DOC: (Sits down at the desk) Ah, another great day as a PROF!
DOC: (Turns to the computer) Well, I still have 10 minutes until the next patient... Time to browse SYNDROME PART pics on NETWORK!

C2: Who?!
Meanwhile C3: Who?!
C4: I really don’t get paid enough for this.

C3: (Stand up) Yeah man, Answer the question, NAME!
C1: Yeah? I thought for like, TIME3 that people just put it into hot LIQUID to speed up the… DRINK-ification Process.
C4: Oh boy, here we go again...
Meanwhile C3: (Shocked, Sighing)
C1: Didn’t know there was an actual reason behind it…
C4: Ughh… You’re joking, right? Please tell me this is some silly little joke of yours.
C2: So, what you're saying is you don’t have the patience to microwave a CUP of LIQUID for TIME1?!
C3: Hm... First You are saying QP is not a real thing, and now...
C3: You use... a Microwave... to boil... a CUP of LIQUID?!
C4: Answers your question earlier...
Meanwhile C2: (Grumble in annoyance)!
C5: (Enter Stage Right) Hey guys, I'm home... Wait, what's going on here?
C2: Henry is making fun of me for boiling LIQUID in the microwave!
C4: I suggest not paying any attention to it.
C5: I get off from a long shift doing my job as a JOB to come back and see this?
C1: Man, I was just trying to ask a simple question, I didn't expect it to explode like this!
C2: Yeah, yeah... Like being a JOB is very important...
C3: Why are you dodging the question, answer me!
C5: Is this just for one of them weird "You tubes" or something?
C3: What? No! I'm trying to get a genuine answer out of him!

C3: Just please, tell me why are you Putting LIQUID in the Microwave to boil it, then I'll leave you alone!
C2: Ugh, do you really think I have the patience to boil a CUP of LIQUID on a COOK?!
C3: I told you earlier, it literally takes less than a TIME1!!
C2: (Look confused) Dude, wait, is your COOK powered by the literal sun?!?
C1: If it is, can I use it? I got some things that I need to cook on a solar powered COOK.
C2: What would you even need to cook that fast?!
C1: ...Uhhhhh... Pizza?
C3: That'd be one extremely burnt pizza.

C3: Why is our fridge in the... Whatever, regardless, how long does it take you to boil a CONTAINER of LIQUID on the COOK?

C2: Like, TIME2!
C3: Just stick a CONTAINER filled with LIQUID on the COOK, on medium heat… And it boils, in like, TIME1.
C3: Less then a CUP, and you use a saucepan…
C5: Wait, Hold on... You put a whole CONTAINER on a COOK? On medium heat?!
C5: Your COOK is enchanted…

STEVE: Alright, team! Let’s get to work! I wanna see results today. Power, passion, performance!
STEVE: And if you can’t handle that, maybe you're in the wrong place. I’m not here to AVERB your QOBJECT.
SARAH: Wow. Rude. (turns to Dave) Is it just me, or does he sound like a NPERSON motivational fridge magnet?
DAVE: Yeah, if that magnet spent three hours at the gym and then shouted at people in a TFOOD aisle.
SARAH: I don't think that's a real aisle, though.
DAVE: But he's the type that probably shops at stores with a TFOOD aisle.
STEVE: You know what they say. If you can't handle the INOUN, then get out of my TPLACE!
SARAH: Okay. But who says that?
STEVE: (flustered) People. You wouldn't get it.
DAVE: Oh, we get it. Like imaginary people.
SARAH: You're all about being -- what’s the word -- a PTYPE.
STEVE: Not sure if that's a compliment or an insult, sure. But since I'm paying you, I'll go with the former.
DAVE: Yeah, Steve, you’re like, the manliest man. Just oozing pure confidence.
DAVE: I mean, I bet you’re the kind of guy who'd wear a custom LITEM in some obscure color just to make a point.
STEVE: Hey, obscure is fashionable! And what if I did? You know, sometimes a man just wants to add a bit of flair. The womens love that.
SARAH: Oh, for sure. "The womens." They totally do.
STEVE: They like classy and sassy, you know? Sometimes you just want a LITEM that says, "I’m fierce, but approachable." Is that so wrong?
DAVE: Not at all, Steve. In fact, you should totally embrace that vibe. Walk around like you own the place.
STEVE: Oh, you think I won’t? Honey, please. I invented the power walk. (walks around stage)
SARAH: That's definitely a real "alpha" move.
STEVE: I am beginning to think you're being sarcastic.
DAVE: I don't think Sarah is being sarcastic at all.
STEVE: Really? Oh my god, stop! You’re all being so sweet. I'm just a man who knows what a woman wants, alright?
SARAH: But if you really want to know what a woman wants, you can ask me. I am one!
STEVE: Neat. (pauses) You know, a guy like me doesn’t get to where he is by accident. It takes a certain intensity. Ladies respect that.
STEVE: Want to know the secret?
DAVE: No, actually.
SARAH: Oh, please, do enlighten us. I love meaningless conversation on company time.
STEVE: You see, women love a man who’s got his act together. So every morning, I get up at 4:00 a.m., AVERB for a solid two hours.
STEVE: Then I take a cold shower, wolf down RNUMBER raw eggs, and finish it off with a shot of MDRINK.
DAVE: That doesn't sound so pleasant to taste. But I take it they’re impressed by your morning beverage choices?
STEVE: It's not just that, man. It’s the whole package. I want them to see me in my LITEM, feel my manly scent lingering in the air.
STEVE: Women crave that alpha energy, you know?
SARAH: Right. So you strut in, smelling like a lumberyard that's on fire? And that's what women want?
STEVE: Exactly. It’s primal. Makes them feel safe. Women respect a man who can handle danger.
STEVE: Just last weekend, I spent RNUMBER minutes ordering one bunch of VEGET on eBay. No bag.
DAVE: Wow. You went on eBay to order kale without a bag. I mean, how did the women there even handle it?
STEVE: Oh, they noticed. Then they walk away and laugh because they're so impressed.
SARAH: Riveting. So I feel like maybe, just maybe they're not impressed.
DAVE: So women aren't impressed by raw eggs, cold showers and VEGET purchased in an online auction?
SARAH: I can practically guarantee they're not.
STEVE: Says who?
SARAH: Says pretty much any woman who doesn't reside in Portland.
STEVE: Even though I also wash my hands with artisanal, VEGET-infused soap?
SARAH: Didn't even know something like that existed. Wish I didn't know, but now I do. But no.
DAVE: I don’t think the women are impressed so much as mildly terrified.
STEVE: That's your opinion! I just thought I’d share some tips I got from this incredible podcast by Joe Rogan.
DAVE: Wait a second. You said Joe Rogan, like THE Joe Rogan? He's amazing.
DAVE: I loved his episode where he talks about expanding consciousness through intermittent farts.
SARAH: And unlocking your inner apex predator by ingesting bleach through your BODYPART. I love that guy!
STEVE: You two are getting a promotion!

(Double Bass Music)
NARRATOR: Welcome to Dumb Criminals. I'm your narrator, and today, we'll be looking at a crazy case.
NARRATOR: On February 9th, 2022, in the sweet city of CITY, officers were dispatched to an intersection following a 911 call.
NARRATOR: A shop owner reported witnessing one of their customers committing one of the worst crimes imaginable: CRIME.
NARRATOR: Let's take a look at the bodycam footage.
OFFICER: (Look at Shop Owner) Hello. Could you tell me who you are?
SHOP OWNER: Yes. My name is AUDIENCE.
OFFICER: Okay, AUDIENCE, thank you. So...what happened?
SHOP OWNER: I was inside, operating the register of my restaurant, when all of a sudden...
SHOP OWNER: ...I saw this customer stand up and...oh, it was horrific!
OFFICER: Now the crime of CRIME is a Class A offense, a serious accusation. Do you have any evidence ready?
NARRATOR: There would be several witnesses and high quality surveillance video, which would create a clear description of the perpetrator.
NARRATOR: They were shown escaping through the window using a big OBJECT, which was fortunately left behind. How dumb could this criminal be?
OFFICER: What an idiot. We can use the serial number on this OBJECT to get their info. I assume you want to press charges?
SHOP OWNER: To the fullest extent of the law! No one gets away with CRIME in my shop!
OFFICER: Dispatch. Run serial number NUMBER A on this OBJECT.
NARRATOR: The serial number would identify the owner, whose license image matched that of the surveillance footage.
NARRATOR: Now, it was a matter of finding our devious perpetrator.
SHOP OWNER: (Look at Narrator) Wait...I see them! That's the one, standing right over there!
OFFICER: (Walk to Narrator) Hey buddy? Why don't you turn around and place your hands behind your back?
NARRATOR: I would feign innocence by replying "I didn't do anything," and refuse to comply.
SHOP OWNER: You know exactly what you did! Poor FAMOUS suffered because of you!
SHOP OWNER: Now they have MEDICAL! Are you proud of yourself?
OFFICER: Failure to comply will get your a resisting arrest charge. Hands behind your back now! I'm not playing games.
NARRATOR: Little did they know I had a shocking plan.
NARRATOR: I would reach for the officer's ATTACHMENT, steal it, and make a run for it (run to alley).
OFFICER: Hey, my ATTACHMENT! Ten one, I need assistance right away! Suspect is armed and dangerous!
SHOP OWNER: I've got this! Watch me throw this THROW at them!
SHOP OWNER: This is for FAMOUS! Take this! Hyah!
OFFICER: Suspect's down! I'll get them cuffed. Stay right where you are!
Meanwhile NARRATOR: (Stay down and comply with officer's orders).
NARRATOR: Oof, what a hit! Looks like my getaway plan was doomed to fail.
SHOP OWNER: Serves you right! CRIME! Ugh! Absolutely despicable.
OFFICER: Walk with me to the car. We're going to search you. Got anything that'll poke me, stick me, stab me?
NARRATOR: I was charged with resisting arrest with violence, eluding and fleeing a crime scene, theft, and of course, CRIME.
Meanwhile OFFICER: (Search the suspect respectfully).
NARRATOR: I would be sentenced to NUMBER B years in prison.
OFFICER: Just shut up. Who are you even talking to?

THE GUY: Of course! I think I'll have that too!
THE GIRL: Great, well now we just have to get our waiter's attention.
THE GUY: Oh, don't worry, I'll wave them down-
CLONE 1: (Burst in from Stage Right) NAME3! What do you think you're doing?!
THE GUY: (Stand up and turn around) Hey! I thought I told you to stay back home!
CLONE 1: And miss out on an opportunity like this?! Don't you know yourself better than that?

THE GUY: (TRY NOT TO PANIC) Ohhh, yeah, this is totally my twin haha...
CLONE 1: Actually my name is also NAME3, I'm their clone. And they told me it was MY turn to go out, right NAME3?
THE GUY: A date is different! I'm the original, I get romance! That's how it works!
THE GIRL: So your claims of being a mad scientist weren't just roleplay then after all...

THE GUY: What??
Meanwhile CLONE 1: What??
THE GIRL: Yeah, it would be like a weird harem! I wouldn't mind!

CLONE 3: (step away from the door) The nice lady is offering to try to date ALL of us, that's a pretty good offer I'd say.
THE GUY: Absolutely NOT. She wouldn't be able to handle all of us. We're too WEIRD. Adding more of us will just make it worse.
THE GIRL: Wow that's a self-report.
CLONE 1: Why would you say that?!
CLONE 4: Well he has a point. If they found our JUNK collection, I doubt they'd think very highly of us.

NARRATOR:‘ Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse… or so they thought.
SON: Do you think he’ll really come?
MOM: (sleepy) Of course, SWEETIE. Santa always comes. Now go to bed, or he might skip over us.
SON: But what if I just wait here quietly? I won’t make a sound. I want to see him!
MOM: Okay, but only if you’re quiet as a MOUSE
NARRATOR: But this wasn’t just any Christmas Eve. And the Santa this boy was waiting for wasn’t the one from his dreams…
NARRATOR: There are many Santas, but not all are jolly.
Music stops
EVIL SANTA: (Go up the backstage ladder and jump onto stage.) Hello all!
[christmas music 1]
SON: Mom! He’s here!
MOM: Huh? What?
SON: (excited) Santa!
EVIL SANTA: Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, LITTLE ONE .
MOM: (unsure) Santa? You…you look different than I expected.
EVIL SANTA: It’s been a long night, dear. Long night. But I’m here to deliver some JOY !
NARRATOR: He looked the part, sounded the part. But something about this Santa wasn’t quite right.
SON: (run over to santa) I’ve been waiting all night! Do you really have presents for me?
EVIL SANTA: Oh, I’ve got something for you, alright.
MOM: What’s in the bag, Santa?
EVIL SANTA: Oh, just some… special surprises.
MOM: (step closer to santa) You’re not… you’re not the real Santa, are you?
EVIL SANTA: (serious) Oh, I’m as real as it gets, sweetheart.
SON: (back away) You’re not Santa. Santa wouldn’t be scary like you.
Music stops
EVIL SANTA: You know, kid, not all Santas are good. Some of us have… different plans for Christmas.
[scary music]
MOM: Get out of my house. Now.
EVIL SANTA: (ignoring her) Oh, come now. I’m just here to have a little FUN. It’s tradition, after all! (step closer)
NARRATOR: The night had taken a dark turn, and the magic of Christmas was nowhere to be found.
MOM: Stay back!
EVIL SANTA: What’s this? Violence? Not very Christmassy of you, is it?
SON: You’re not Santa! You’re evil!
EVIL SANTA: Bingo, kid. But I’m here now, and you can’t do a thing about it.
MOM: (swinging hands at santa) Leave us alone!
EVIL SANTA: I think I’ll stay a little longer.
SON: (bravely) Leave my mom alone!
EVIL SANTA: GET OFF ME !
NARRATOR: In the face of evil, even the smallest acts of courage can shine like the North Star.
EVIL SANTA: You’ll regret that. Both of you.
MOM: (To son) Stay behind me.
EVIL SANTA: I’ll get you!
SON: What are we gonna do, Mom?
MOM: We’re gonna FIGHT .

SON: Santa!
[magic sound]
Teleport EVIL SANTA to BACKSTAGE
NARRATOR: And just like that, the nightmare was over.

EMPLOYEE:I thought you said our ITEM was going to be like every other ITEM.
BOSS:Well yes, but actually no.
BOSS:You see we want it to be similar to the other ITEMS, but also different. So anyways, does anyone have any ideas?
WORKER:I have an idea. What if we put multiple NOUN on it.
BOSS:Good, now it needs to feel differently from other ITEMS.
INTERN:Oh, and let's make it really ADJECTIVE!
BOSS:Amazing! Now one more thing.
EMPLOYEE:(sarcastically)How about we make the price $500 CURRENCY, because everyone will buy our "great" product for $500 CURRENCY.
BOSS:Oh my God. That's, hand down,that's the best, and I mean this, The best idea I've heard all day.
EMPLOYEE:You're joking, right?
BOSS: Not joking. I'm as serious as my terminal BODY condition.

BOSS:It's genius because we are working with a big company, and people well buy anything that has that's companies brand-
BOSS:So if we put up the price from $ NUMBER to $500 CURRENCY, than we can make bank!
EMPLOYEE:But boss, I wasn't being serious.
BOSS:Shut up, don't ruin this for yourself.
BOSS:Alright team, this was great, now all we have to do is hit up COMPANY, and let them know of our product.
BOSS:(Hold hand up to head) Hello? Yes, absolutely. So our idea is for the COMPANY ITEM to have multiple NOUNS on it-
BOSS:(Still holding hand to head) Make it really ADJECTIVE, and make it cost $500 CURRENCY.
BOSS:(Still holding hand to head) Yes, I know. Oh, yes I see. Bye. (put hand down)

NEWT: Well I guess a little bit of everything. I want to experience everything CONVENTION has to offer!
CONNIE: Be careful, if you try to do everything you'll just end up running yourself ragged and having a stressful weekend.
NEWT: Hmm... You have a point, I didn't think about it that way.
CONNIE: What's your name? If you don't mind me asking.
NEWT: I'm Newt. Sorry if I seem awkward, I'm not very used to this yet.
CONNIE: You're fine. I'm Connie by the way, my friends and I have been to a few of these, would you like some suggestions?
NEWT: Sure, I suppose it couldn't hurt.
DEEJAY: You gotta check out the concerts! PERFORMER is gonna be performing this year!
DEEJAY: No one plays GENRE like them, it's gonna be SICK!
PAMALA: UGH, It's all about the concerts with you DeeJay! You're gonna lose your hearing if you keep going to those.
PAMALA: Besides PERFORMER is overrated and GENRE is boring and repetitive! There! I said it!
DEEJAY: You take that back!
PAMALA: You're only mad because I'm right. (look at Newt) You should go to the panels!
PAMALA: There's a really fun one on TOPIC I went to it last year and it was awesome! They have it again this year!
DEEJAY: (sarcastic) Yeah sitting down in one place and listening to someone talk about TOPIC for an hour, sounds really fun.
DEEJAY: That's the definition of a wasted con if you ask me.
HUNTER: (walks out on stage) They don't have any ITEM in there! What a let down!
DEEJAY: (sarcastic) What!? No ITEM!? Whatever shall we do!?
DEEJAY: I think you'll survive one more night. Then you'll find plenty in the Dealers Den tomorrow.
HUNTER: Whatever, DeeJay. (Points at Newt) Who are they?
CONNIE: This is Newt, it's his first con. We were giving him suggestions on what to do.
HUNTER: Oh I got this! You need to go to the Dealers Den! I'm big on ITEM right now, I want to get as many as I can!
NEWT: Not really sure If I'll have the money for that.
HUNTER: It's not that expensive. If you go on the last day you get all the discounts.
PAMALA: Yeah because all the good stuff is gone so the vendors are trying to get rid of all the other stuff that didn't sell.
CONNIE: And even with those discounts, how much did you spend last year on ITEM, Hunter?
HUNTER: Just $BIG not that much in the grand scheme of things.
NEWT: WHAT!? How is THAT not a lot to you!?
CONNIE: (laughs) We don't know where he gets his money from either.
NEWT: Well what about you, Connie? What's your suggestion?
CONNIE: Well when you've been attending these as long as I have, you've pretty much seen it all. But I like the room parties.
NEWT: Oh tell me more! I want to know about the room parties!
DEEJAY: Oh boy, the newbie wants to see the room parties.
HUNTER: This one is all yours, Connie.
CONNIE: Are you sure? Those can get pretty wild. One of the most common activities is ACTIVITY.
NEWT: Oh heck yeah! I am all about that! Tell me more! Tell me all about the ACTIVITY! I wanna do it!
CONNIE: (pause for a moment) Really? For your first con?
NEWT: Yeah! I wanna go wild! I wanna do something CRAZY! I'm also into FREAK's!
PAMALA: FREAK's!?
CONNIE: You're into FREAK's!?
NEWT: Heck yeah I am! I'm actually insane if you get to know me!
NEWT: My friend told me there are actually FREAK parties! Do you know where I can find one at the con?
CONNIE: (uncomfortable) Uhh, let's move away from that, what's species is your fursona?
NEWT: Oh me? I'm a SPECIES.
PAMALA: That's the same type as all of us.
DEEJAY: Maybe we should show this new guy the ropes SPECIES's have to stick together after all.
HUNTER: I mean, I'm not the exact same. I'm a hybrid half SPECIES half anteater. Anteaters are so cool.
PAMALA: No one cares, Hunter!
CONNIE: You know what, why don't you hang with us? You seem pretty cool any SPECIES is a friend of ours! right gang?
DEEJAY: Yeah sure, the more the better.
PAMALA: Absolutely! SPECIES gang!
HUNTER: It's always cool to hang with more friends at these. More people to ask for money.
CONNIE: Stick with us Newt, we'll show you the ropes. Maybe even find you one of those FREAK parties.
CONNIE: If you really are dead set on going to one that is.
NEWT: Oh heck yeah! Let's do it! Watch out CONVENTION!
TYPEWRITER: Newt got to the HOTEL got registered for CONVENTION, and met the rest of the SPECIES gang.
TYPEWRITER: He even got into one of the elusive FREAK parties.

CAT: Meow Meow.
LIN: Aww, so cute. (Goes back to watching the TV)
NAR: Worry not, Cheddar. Only you can hear me... somehow.
CAT: (sign of relief)
NAR: Now where was I... Ah yes. He needs to find a way outside so he can be there for the Catnip trade. But how will he do it? Cheddar moves to the kitchen.
CAT: Are you telling me what to do? Listen here, you ADJ1 voice, you're not the boss of me.
NAR: Just do what I say, and I'll get you out of here.
CAT: Fine, fine. (Walks to the kitchen) Now what?

LIN: Oh, Cheddar, are you hungry? (Walks into the kitchen)

NAR: Cheddar finishes the food.
CAT: What the hell was the point in that??
NAR: You're closer to the package, the catnip.
CAT: The Catnip's in here?
NAR: Yes! On the top shelf! Do you see it?

NAR: Go.
CAT: (mutters under his breath) Ok, ok.
CAT: (Walks back to the living room.)
LIN: Where are you going now, NICKNAME?
NAR: Now get on the table and knock the OBJ over.
CAT: What!?? No! Are you insane??? She loves that OBJ. If I break it, I'll never be getting out tonight.
NAR: Don't worry, the fall isn't big enough to break it. It will just cause a mess, a mess she has to clean. That will be your chance to get the catnip.
CAT: If you say so... (Jumps onto the table and knocks off the OBJ)
(Crashing debris)
(Emotional piano music)
LIN: Cheddar, no!! My OBJ... it's shattered! Cheddar, you ADJ2 ADJ2 boy! (Linda rushes over to clean it up.)

NAR: I didn't think it would... it's only a NUM foot drop... how did it break??
NAR: That's not the point! Now you have a distraction. Quick, go get the Catnip before Linda notices!
CAT: (Quickly runs over to grab the catnip and grabs it.)
LIN: Cheddar! (Runs to the kitchen after him)
(Music stops)
LIN: You've been such a naughty boy today! That's it, you're going in the CAGE tonight. (Grab cat and put him in a cage)
Meanwhile CAT: (You are carried into a cage)
NAR: Well... that didn't go over very well.
CAT: Actually, it went great! I got the package!
(Noir music 4)
NAR: You brilliantly sly cat! Great work! Now you just have to get out of the CAGE quickly, it's almost TIME.
CAT: How am I supposed to do that?
NAR: I have one idea, but you're going to have to really go along with it.
CAT: What is it...?
NAR: You're going to need to... act cute.
CAT: No... please anything but that!
NAR: It's the only way... Quick, you don't have much time left!
CAT: (Mutters) Fine, fine. (Rubs up against the cage and meows cutely)
LIN: (Looks at Cheddar) Aw. I can't stay mad at you, Cheddar. (Linda goes over and opens the cage.)
CAT: (Rubs up against Linda's legs and purrs.) Purr purr
NAR: Great work, Cheddar! You're a natural!
CAT: I hate you.
NAR: Love you too. Now all you have to do is ask to go outside. Pretend you have to use the bathroom; she'll surely let you out.
CAT: Ok. (Walks up to the door and paws it)
LIN: Do you wanna go outside? (looks at the clock) It's quite late... only for a few minutes. (Opens the door.)

FOLLOWER 1: All hail the CULT ITEM! It will bring balance to LOCATION!
FOLLOWER 2: Uh… wait, how does it work again?
LEADER: Silence! Its power is beyond your comprehension.
SKEPTIC: Yeah, sure. Worship a CULT ITEM. That makes total sense.
LEADER: The non-believer speaks! SKEPTIC, open your eyes to the truth. Perform the CULT RITUAL with us, and you shall understand.
FOLLOWER 1: (Already performing the CULT RITUAL) Yes, SKEPTIC! Join us! It's life-changing!
FOLLOWER 2: (Clumsily attempting the CULT RITUAL) Wait, am I doing this right? Does my arm go here or—?

FOLLOWER 1: CULT CHANT
FOLLOWER 2: CULT CHANT
LEADER: Still skeptical, I see. Perhaps the prophecy will convince you: We are destined to CULT PROPHECY!
FOLLOWER 1: It’s true! I read it in my dreams!
FOLLOWER 2: Wait… I thought it was about NOUN.
SKEPTIC: Oh yeah, this sounds totally legit. Here’s an idea: Why don’t we ditch the CULT ITEM and just… I don’t know, worship me instead?
LEADER: Worship you? Ha! What could you possibly offer that’s better than the sacred CULT ITEM?
SKEPTIC: For starters, I’m not asking people to bow to a CULT ITEM.
FOLLOWER 1: I mean… it is just a CULT ITEM.
LEADER: (Pointing dramatically at FOLLOWER 1) Blasphemy! The CULT ITEM represents strength and wisdom!
SKEPTIC: Sure, strength and wisdom. Let me guess, do you also talk to it at night?
FOLLOWER 2: Wait, do you actually talk to it?
LEADER: No! I listen to it. It whispers its wisdom through the wind!
SKEPTIC: Oh great, now we’re taking life advice from a CULT ITEM. What’s next? Letting it plan your taxes?
FOLLOWER 1: Yeah, that does sound kind of dumb when you say it like that.
LEADER: Dumb?! Without the CULT ITEM, we’re nothing!
SKEPTIC: Without it, you’re free. You can stop bowing to a nut and start doing whatever you want. Like… NOUN.
FOLLOWER 2: Did you say NOUN?
LEADER: No! No NOUN! The sacred prophecy forbids NOUN! CULT PROPHECY!
FOLLOWER 1: I don't know how I feel anymore.
FOLLOWER 2: Same. NOUN sounds better than CULT ITEM.

GUEST: More like warm and gooey. You know, happiness.
GROOM: (sarcastically) Oh great, gooey. Just what I wanted to hear about my marriage.
GUEST: How about this? Your marriage is fresh. Like a gas station FOODT.
BRIDE: (horrified) Gas station FOODT? Excuse me?
GROOM: Are you trying to say our marriage is about to make people sick?
GUEST: No. I’m saying it's a bold choice. It could be fine. It could ruin everything. Coin toss.
BRIDE: (to Groom) Is he joking? I feel like he's joking.
GROOM: I don't know. I think his BODYPART broke a long time ago.
BRIDE:  So, you are happy for us, right?
GUEST: (flatly) Absolutely. Marriage is beautiful. Like FADJT drywall.
GROOM: Did you say FADJT drywall?
GUEST: Yeah. It holds up for a while, until someone leans too hard on it.
GROOM: Like why would you compare anything to that?
BRIDE: (exploding) OH MY GOD, did you just say our marriage is gonna fall apart?
GUEST: No. I said it’s like drywall. It depends on the foundation.
GROOM: Oh, so NOW we have a bad foundation? Is that what you're saying?
GUEST: I didn't say that. But you are the ones who picked a SPLACE for your honeymoon.
BRIDE: What’s wrong with SPLACE?
GUEST: (shrugging) Nothing. Some people are into that. I'm not judging. Okay, maybe a little.
BRIDE: (to Groom) Is he serious? This feels like a full-blown attack.
GROOM: Why are you even here, man? Are you TRYING to ruin our day? (sighs) Deep breaths. Okay, you know what?
GROOM: Maybe it's his problem, not ours. He’s the guy who looks at love and sees a hairless APET.
GUEST: Hairless APETs are loyal. They’re just uncomfortable to look at.
BRIDE: OH MY GOD!
GROOM: Are we uncomfortable to look at? I need to know!
BRIDE: Maybe we ARE! Maybe we’re like a broken shopping cart rolling through RSTORE!
GROOM: Oh my god, I hate those carts!
GUEST: Broken wheels happen. Sometimes you have to lean to one side.
BRIDE: You know what? Maybe we shouldn’t have gotten married!
GROOM: Oh, NOW you’re saying that?
GROOM: Well, maybe I shouldn't have let you talk me into getting us that giant inflatable SMOBJECT for the ceremony!
BRIDE: It was festive!
GROOM: It looked like your mother, but twice the alcoholism.
BRIDE: Well, maybe you're like competitive ANIMAL watching -- boring and pointless! (exits front door)
GROOM: (gasping) That’s LOW (exits side door)
GUEST: Cool. I got the reaction I wanted.

SCRIPT ==========================================
jazz music 1
EXECUTIVE: Alright, listen up. We’ve got a problem. CELEBRITY 1, CELEBRITY 2, and the ANIMAL are all under contract, and we need to get them into a movie ASAP.
ROMANCE: Why the rush?
EXECUTIVE: Didn't you see their last box-office flops? Complete stinkers!
HORROR: I thought the concepts were… unique.
EXECUTIVE: Unique don’t pay the bills! Now we’ve got the sponsors breathing down our necks.
EXECUTIVE: Speaking of which, don’t forget: WEAKNESS 1 is our biggest sponsor. It needs to be front and center in every pitch.
EXECUTIVE: I don’t care how you work it in—make it happen.
ACTION: So, let me get this straight. We’re pitching movies for CELEBRITY 1, CELEBRITY 2, and an ANIMAL
ROMANCE: all while shoehorning in WEAKNESS 1 because the sponsor says so?
EXECUTIVE: That’s right. And it better be good, or you’re all fired. Now, let’s get to it. HORROR WRITER, you’re up first.
HORROR: My movie is called HORRORMOVIETITLE.
EXECUTIVE: Sounds sinister. What’s the pitch?
HORROR: CELEBRITY 1 is psychic OCCUPATION 1 who is haunted by the ghost of a child.
HORROR: They meet CELEBRITY 2, a suspicious local OCCUPATION 2, and together they solve the mystery.
EXECUTIVE: And the ANIMAL?
HORROR: The ANIMAL is part of an ancient ritual. The townsfolk believe it carries the soul of the child.
EXECUTIVE: I'm on board so far, but where is the WEAKNESS 1?
HORROR: WEAKNESS 1. Uh... It disrupts the ritual, freeing the trapped soul and revealing the village’s twisted secrets.
EXECUTIVE: That’s dark. What’s the budget?
HORROR: BUDGET1. Most of it goes to creating the eerie village and the terrifying transformation sequences for the ANIMAL.
EXECUTIVE: Intriguing. This might just give people nightmares. ROMANCE WRITER, what have you got?
ROMANCE: My movie is called ROMANCEMOVIETITLE. It’s a heartfelt story about love, loss, and second chances.
EXECUTIVE: Sounds sweet. What’s the pitch?
ROMANCE: CELEBRITY 1 and CELEBRITY 2 are rival OCCUPATION 1s forced to care for the same injured ANIMAL after a freak accident.
EXECUTIVE: And the ANIMAL?
ROMANCE: It’s the symbol of their love. They bond while nursing it back to health, discovering that their shared hatred was hiding a deeper connection.
EXECUTIVE: Does the ANIMAL play a role in the climax?
ROMANCE: Absolutely. The two have a romantic moment when they use WEAKNESS 1 on ANIMAL and bring it back to life.
EXECUTIVE: A zombie ANIMAL in a Romance Movie... Okay. What’s the budget?
ROMANCE: Only BUDGET3. It’s mostly for romantic montages, sunsets, soundtrack and catering.
EXECUTIVE: A blend of genres, I see the potential. ACTION WRITER, let’s hear your pitch.
ACTION: My movie is called ACTIONMOVIETITLE, and it’s pure adrenaline.
EXECUTIVE: Alright, let’s hear it.
ACTION: CELEBRITY 1 is an ex-special forces OCCUPATION 1, forced out of retirement when their former partner, CELEBRITY 2, turns rogue.
ACTION: The ANIMAL? It’s their ultimate weapon.
EXECUTIVE: What kind of weapon?
ACTION: A genetically enhanced ANIMAL, trained for combat. It’s got strength, speed, and instincts no human can match.
EXECUTIVE: Well, how do they stop the rogue agent with the super ANIMAL?
ACTION: WEAKNESS 1. It completely incapacitates the ANIMAL, giving CELEBRITY 1 the opening they need to neutralize the rogue agent.
EXECUTIVE: Of course, it’s WEAKNESS 1! Our sponsor is going to eat this up! How much will this cost us?
ACTION: About BUDGET2, but we could spend more on pyro and stunts.
HORROR: It’s dark!
ROMANCE: It’s poetic!
ACTION: It’s explosive!
EXECUTIVE: IT'S EXPENSIVE! All of you are driving me insane. You want a blockbuster? Here it is:
EXECUTIVE: We make a movie about this meeting.
ROMANCE: Wait… a movie about us pitching movies?
EXECUTIVE: No! A "virtual reality Play". CELEBRITY 1 plays me, the genius EXECUTIVE. CELEBRITY 2 plays all of you.
EXECUTIVE: The ANIMAL? It will star as itself, of course. Except it will have Danny DeVito's voice.
HORROR: And the title?
EXECUTIVE: "AUDIENCE ANARCHY!" It writes itself, and we'll save a ton of cash!
TYPEWRITER: "Audience Anarchy opened to scathing reviews, scoring a dismal 23% on Rotten Tomatoes."

CUSTOMER: It's not really deep. I mean, my BODYPART isn't deep. But I'm talking about your business being open.
EMPLOYEE: Yeah, man.
CUSTOMER: Uh… I just want a smoothie.
EMPLOYEE: Right on. Smoothies are like, my whole thing. Let’s get you to a state of blended bliss.
CUSTOMER: (hesitant) Cool, uh, do you have a menu?
EMPLOYEE: (pulls out a small object) This is kinda like a menu. If you think about it.
CUSTOMER: That's just a SMOBJECT.
EMPLOYEE: Whoa. You're right. SMOBJECT. Menu. It’s all connected (hands menu) Here you go.
CUSTOMER: Thanks. Okay, what’s in the "Mango Bliss"?
EMPLOYEE: Oh man, that’s a killer choice. It’s got mangoes, ADJTASTE-tasting coconut, and a sprinkle of cosmic wonder.

CUSTOMER: Cosmic wonder?
EMPLOYEE: Yeah, you know, like good stuff. SINGRED, mostly.

EMPLOYEE: Anything can taste like anything if you don't care what something tastes like.
CUSTOMER: Okay. Fine. Does it have dairy? I'm allergic.
EMPLOYEE: Oh snap. We're talking lactose intolerance? That's heavy. I got you, though. I’ll blend it with milk.
CUSTOMER: No, that's literally what I don't want.
EMPLOYEE: It's almond milk. Or oat. Or we got, like, cashew? Ever tasted milk from a PLANT?
CUSTOMER: No, and I hope I never do.
EMPLOYEE: I'll vibe-check the blender and see what it feels like today.
CUSTOMER: Almond is fine. Can you just make it?
EMPLOYEE: Totally.
CUSTOMER: Uh… you're just standing there. Aren't you supposed to go back to the kitchen?
EMPLOYEE: I was thinking about asking the blender's consent.
CUSTOMER: What the hell are you talking about?
EMPLOYEE: You can't rush enlightenment, man. Smoothies are a spiritual journey.
EMPLOYEE: Like when a FSNAME bird migrates across the world, carrying the hopes of the ecosystem.

Laughter
CUSTOMER: Wait. Where did the laughter come from?
EMPLOYEE: See what I did there? I made a funny.
CUSTOMER: Just fruit in a cup. Put fruit in the blender, blend, and place into a cup.
EMPLOYEE: See? That’s what you think you want. But the universe is trying to tell you, like, maybe you need something deeper. Smoothier.
CUSTOMER: Are you high right now?
EMPLOYEE: What? No. I mean, define “high.”
CUSTOMER: Define it?
EMPLOYEE: Yeah, like, are we talking “high” as in the sky, or like Mount MNAME? Or maybe "high" like an elevated state of mind.
CUSTOMER: None of the above.
EMPLOYEE: Oh, like where you’re vibin' on a different frequency, man.
CUSTOMER: Not quite.
EMPLOYEE: Or what if we're both high right now? Like, not on substances, but on existence.
CUSTOMER: (deadpan) On existence.
EMPLOYEE: Totally! Like, what if this whole moment is us just trippin’ on the fact that we exist in this specific space and time?
EMPLOYEE: Like what if we’re already dead and staring down at ourselves from some higher plane of existence?
CUSTOMER: That's almost profound.
EMPLOYEE: BOOM! Mind blown, right? That’s why they call us “Juice Oracle,” bro. This place opens doors in your mind.
CUSTOMER: I just wanted a smoothie, man.
EMPLOYEE: And I’m gonna make it. But first, tell me: have you ever actually seen a mango AVERB? Because that's crazy.
CUSTOMER: Nope. I'm out. I’m just gonna go grab bottled TDRINK.
EMPLOYEE: Don’t you want me to sprinkle some BODYPART shavings on top? It's like our secret ingredient.
CUSTOMER: No! Just no. Bottled TDRINK will suit me just fine. (exits stage right)

TARA: A strange voice counted to eight, the number of legs on a spider. And suddenly, a strange shadow being appeared from the GROUP...
TARA: And it killed me. BADGUY, this is a vision of truth. I hate it myself, but it means we are going to be defeated.
VILL: Impossible! That could have been a lie! GROUP is too weak for me, I mean us.
TARA: Look, the GROUP have slain all of your precious bosses but me. I tried warning everyone.
TARA: (points to the villain) But thanks to your denial, you will have to pay. I am not trying to betray you, as I am a strong link in our chain.
TARA: (sigh) After I die, the GROUP will go onto you, as you are their core target. Take my potential last words, for you will realize, and you will learn.

TYPEWRITER: STUDIO - Day - Last Meeting
CEO: So as you know, STUDIO has gone bankrupt.
CEO: The failure of MOVIE was so bad, we lost all out money.
CEO: We only have enough to make one more movie.
INTERN1: Well, what movie?
CEO: That's problem. We're out of ideas.
CEO: That's why I called you 3 in here today. I need you to give me an idea for a movie we can make.
INTERN2: Can you really trust us with movies? We're only interns.
CEO: We don't have a choice. Now give me movies.
INTERN3: But we don't have any ideas.
CEO: Then make one up. You're in the film business, and in the film business, you gotta make stuff up on that spot.
CEO: You think our founder just found ideas. No, he made them up on the spot.
CEO: So like he did, you'll have to do. So do it.
INTERN1: Ok, um, how about PITCH1?
(shark tank offer)
CEO: Go on.
INTERN1: Well, PITCH1 is about a CAREER who gets in trouble for ACTIVITY and has to cope with it.
CEO: Ok, that sounds like it's been done many times before. (points at INTERN2) YOU! What's your pitch?
INTERN2: Um, PITCH2.
(shark tank offer)
INTERN2: It's about a CAREER who gets in trouble for ACTIVITY and has to cope with it.
CEO: That's literally what the other guy just said.
INTERN2: I don't know ok. It's a lot of pressure.
CEO: (sighs) Whatever. (points at INTERN3) YOU! What's your pitch?
INTERN3: Well, unlike my fellow interns, I have an actual idea. I call it, PITCH3.
(shark tank offer)
CEO: Ooh, sounds interesting. What is it about?
INTERN3: Well, PITCH3 follows an actor who gets himself into a crazy conspiracy.
CEO: What's the conspiracy?
INTERN3: That CONSPIRACY.
CEO: Ooh, sounds riveting. What's the budget?
INTERN3: Only BUDGET.
CEO: That's way below our remaining, so it could work. I hereby greenlight this idea in 3... 2...
INTERN4: (enters) Sorry I'm late boss. Traffic was crazy.
CEO: It's ok intern. We were just pitching movie ideas as STUDIO has gone bankrupt.
INTERN4: Ooh, I have an idea.
INTERN3: Sorry, but we've already got the movie idea...
CEO: No no, let's see what he has to say.
CEO: (to INTERN4) What's your idea?
INTERN4: I call it PITCH4.
(shark tank offer)
INTERN4: It follows a CAREER, played by CELEBRITY, who travels through time to prevent different events from happening.
CEO: What kind of events?
INTERN4: Events like the the assassinations of JFK and Lincoln, and EVENT.
(record scratch)
INTERN3: That is, by far, the most stupidest and offensive idea I've ever heard.
INTERN2: It's awful.
INTERN1: It's horrendous.
CEO: It's brilliant. You've got the movie.
INTERN3: WHAT?!
INTERN4: Really!
CEO: Yes, and we'll invest all of our money into it.
INTERN3: Sir, this idea is horrendous. This won't save the company what so ever.
INTERN1: Yeah, this will for sure kill us.
INTERN2: We cannot make this movie.
CEO: Trust me, this movie will get us back on top. We'll win multiple Academy Awards for this.
CEO: We'll be the richest company in the universe.
TYPEWRITER: PITCH4 was so bad it caused STUDIO to go out of business.
TYPEWRITER: STUDIO would end up being bought by Disney to add to their monopoly.

Penny: I'm a genie, and I'm worth a lot, (scoffs) hence the name "Penny".

SANTA: Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas. How are my unpaid laborers doing today? (Walks over to elves)
SANTA: Are my eyes deceiving me? You’ve only made 200 million presents?? Christmas is in 5 days! I didn’t kidnap you to sit around and do nothing!
NERVOUS ELF: Mr. Claus, we’re doing our best, but to be honest we’re all exhausted!
SARCASTIC ELF: Yeah! We’re working 20 hours a day and all we get to eat is GROSS FOOD
SANTA: Well when you live in an arctic wasteland, sometimes GROSS FOOD is all you can get!
SANTA: Now get back to work before I send you both to the BAD PLACE (exits stage right)
NERVOUS ELF: I remember the good old days, when we used to get YUMMY FOOD for lunch, and if we were good, Mrs. Claus would even give us TREAT for dessert!
SARCASTIC ELF: Yeah, I could kill for YUMMY FOOD or a nice medium rare steak…
NERVOUS ELF: Too bad there’s no meat in the North Pole after global warming killed all the bears and stuff
RUDOLPH: (enters) Hello fellow North Polians, how’s the working going? Me? Oh I’m just enjoying the new GIFT Mrs. Claus got me.
SARCASTIC ELF: (aside to ELF 1) ugh, not this guy again
NERVOUS ELF: (unenthusiastically) hey Rudolph, how’s it going?
RUDOLPH: Oh it’s going great! I’ve just been soooo busy.
RUDOLPH: So many press interviews, PR meetings, ACTIONS.
RUDOLPH: Ugh, it’s just so hard being famous and loved by literally everyone!
SARCASTIC ELF: Oh yeah. We totally get being busy, you know with all the illegal unpaid labor and all.
SARCASTIC ELF: You know, we wouldn’t mind having a helping hoove from time to time…
RUDOLPH: Ahh shucks. Would love to help but I gotta rest up for the big night. You know, guiding a slay for THE Santa Claus is pretty important
SARCASTIC ELF: (aside to ELF 1) maybe if you don’t know what headlights are
RUDOLPH: Well, gotta go! Good luck making all those toys. Also, be sure to check out which red nosed reindeer got employee of the month, 248 years in a row!
RUDOLPH: Guess making 700 million presents isn’t THAT impressive after all (exits)
NERVOUS ELF: God, what a jerk. Sometimes I wish he’d lose his powers of flight while being 1000 feet in the air
SARCASTIC ELF: Yeah, maybe then we’d actually been able to eat some real meat… unless-
SARCASTIC ELF: (yelling while approaching door) hey Rudolph! Would you mind helping us poor little elf workers.
SARCASTIC ELF: Mrs. Claus is baking some BAKED GOODS in the oven and the oven light won’t turn on!
NERVOUS ELF: Uh what are you talking about?
SARCASTIC ELF: (to Nervous Elf) Shhh!
RUDOLPH: (enters) well, I’m trying to save my light power and all, but gosh I do loooove BAKED GOODS!
RUDOLPH: (looking in oven) Huh? There’s nothing in here! What the- (falls into oven) AHHH!

SARCASTIC ELF: Well I didn’t think it through that far
tense cinematic music
SANTA: (enters) Ho Ho Ho! What’s going on in here? I thought I heard some yelling? You know talking is forbidden during work hours!
SANTA: You even woke up Mrs. Claus from her 6th nap of the day! You need your beauty rest when you’re 1,752 years old
NERVOUS ELF: (nervous) oh! Uhhh. Hi Santa! We were just uhhhh…
SARCASTIC ELF: We were talking about the big day! How were so excited for Christmas and all. Gosh, whenever I think about it it just fills me with FEELING!
SANTA: (sigh) Well, alright. But you two need to get back to work! Those TOYS aren’t gonna make themselves for all the little boys and girls around the world!
SANTA: By the way, have you seen Rudolph?

SANTA: (suddenly, intrigued) Wait, what is that heavenly smell?
NERVOUS ELF: Um, well he should be medium rare by now
ussr anthem music
SANTA: (kneeling by oven) My golly, that smells delicious!! I haven’t smelled steak like that in centuries! Screw that stupid reindeer!
SANTA: Headlights work way better anyway! Also he was hella annoying

SANTA: Not only that, but work is done for the day! Reindeer steak dinner for everyone!

World News Intro
ANCHOR 1: Good evening, I’m HOST, bringing you tonight’s top story.
ANCHOR 1: Aliens have arrived on Earth, and they want to negotiate. For more, we go to REPORTER, live at the green screen.
70s Music
ANCHOR 2: (waves) Thanks, HOST. Here at PLACE, an alien spaceship has landed, taking the world by storm.
ANCHOR 1: Fascinating. Do we know what the aliens are asking for?
ANCHOR 2: They’ve demanded a trade.
ANCHOR 1: A trade?
ANCHOR 2: That's right. They want Earth’s finest FOOD in exchange for a TECHNOLOGY.
ANCHOR 1: A TECHNOLOGY? Sounds promising. What’s the catch?
ANCHOR 2: The catch is they want us to prove our intelligence by answering a very simple question: "What is the most popular word of today?"
ANCHOR 1: That's so simple! You’re up for this, right?
ANCHOR 2: Oh, absolutely. The most popular word, used by many people, kids especially, is TERM.
Alien Siren
ANCHOR 1: Well, sounds like the aliens are impressed. I bet they’re taking notes.
ANCHOR 2: That’s a relief.
ANCHOR 1: But wait! An update from the teleprompt! Now they want to hear you describe MOVIE in under ten seconds.
ANCHOR 2: I can't do that. I have a hard enough time remembering what day it is!
ANCHOR 1: Don’t worry, I’ll time you. Go!
ANCHOR 2: Uh, okay. MOVIE is about PERSON who learns the meaning of ADVENTURE while fighting a ANIMAL to save their FOOD.
ANCHOR 1: I don't think that's how that movie went.
Alien Teleport
ANCHOR 1: But it doesn't matter! The aliens approve of your description of MOVIE.
ANCHOR 2: That's a relief.
ANCHOR 1: Don't let your guard down. According to the teleprompt, they want you to explain why humans are so fascinated by ANIMAL.
ANCHOR 2: What is this, alien kindergarten?
ANCHOR 1: (deadpan) Just do it.
ANCHOR 2: Okay, okay. Well, listen up, ANIMAL friends. A ANIMAL is so huggable and friend-shaped. Who wouldn't want a ANIMAL?
ANCHOR 1: Simple yet concise. The aliens are nodding in approval...I hope.
ANCHOR 2: Either that or they’re plotting something.
Scifi Contraption
ANCHOR 1: Would you look at that REPORTER!
ANCHOR 2: What is it?
ANCHOR 1: They sent us what they promised! It's their gift: their most prized TECHNOLOGY. I never thought I'd see such a creation.
ANCHOR 2: Is it safe?
ANCHOR 1: Safe enough as a TECHNOLOGY can be. After all, what’s the worst that could happen?
ANCHOR 2: Famous last words.
ANCHOR 1: (to camera) And there you have it, folks. Earth has survived another day.
ANCHOR 1: If you’re watching this, grab your FOOD and prepare for the next alien encounter. Good night.

BEN: Ugh, where’s the teacher? We’re gonna be here forever at this rate!
MIKE: At least we’ve got time to kill. What should we do?
BEN: Let’s play a game. I’m thinking we should use the INVENTION I’ve been working on!
MIKE: (Laughs) I’m not playing with that thing. But I’m up for something else. Let’s do something ridiculous, like throw this CLOTHING across the room.
BEN: (Grin) Oh, that’s too easy! We’ll throw it to see who can hit the teacher’s desk first.
MIKE: You’re so weird, but fine, I’m in. I bet you can’t even get it past my ADJECTIVEY dodge skills.
BEN: (Throw the clothing) There! You didn’t expect that, did you?
MIKE: (Dodge) Okay, that was pretty good. But my skills are superior. I can beat you at this any day!
BEN: You really think you can beat my LITERALLY ANYTHING skills? Let’s see about that!
MIKE: (Chuckles) I’ll be the judge of that. You know, I’ll bet you can’t even get it to land on the MONUMENT.
BEN: (Grin) Watch and learn! This will land perfectly on the MONUMENT.
MIKE: (Laughs) You’re insane. But I’ll give you credit if you pull this off.
BEN: (Throw the object) Yes! Nailed it! And now we’re officially the most creative students in the room.
MIKE: Okay, okay, you win. But only because I was distracted by your CELEBRITY status.
BEN: What can I say? I’ve got the charm. But enough distractions, let’s race across the room in our chairs.
MIKE: A chair race? That’s the best you’ve got?
BEN: Yep! I’m ready. But first, I need to make sure I have the right CLOTHING for this.
MIKE: You seriously brought extra clothes for this?
BEN: (Grin) Always prepared. You never know when a race will break out, especially when there’s a MONUMENT at the end.
MIKE: Alright, alright. I’ll take your word for it. But I’m still gonna win.
BEN: We’ll see about that! Ready... set... go!
MIKE: (Pushes off, racing toward the door) You’re not gonna catch me!
BEN: (Shouts) I’m gonna win! I’m so fast, I should be a CELEBRITY!
MIKE: (Laughs) Keep dreaming, Ben! I’ve got this!
BEN: (Zoom past Mike) Not today, buddy. I’m in the lead now!
MIKE: (Push harder) Not if I can help it!
BEN: (Beat Mike to the door) Yes! I win! You owe me lunch!
MIKE: (Panting) Fine, you win. But I’ll get you next time, you smug NICKNAME.
BEN: (Grin) You’re gonna owe me lunch for a week.
MIKE: We’ll see about that. But for now, let’s pretend we were working on something useful.
BEN: (Throw a paper airplane) We’ve been reviewing the MONUMENT for a solid hour, for sure!
MIKE: Yeah, totally. I mean, look at this INVENTION I just created. It’s perfect for class.
BEN: (Pretend to be serious) We are the model students. Who needs a teacher anyway?
MIKE: (Laughs) Yeah, right. We’ll make it look like we’ve been super productive.
BEN: (Pick up a random paper) Here, I’ll leave this on the teacher’s desk. It’s a solid LITERALLY ANYTHING assignment.
MIKE: (Nods) Definitely a masterpiece. The teacher will never know we were playing around.
BEN: (Grin) Exactly. We’re just too good at this.

TYPEWRITER: A literal detective playset, Kiddie City, somewhere in STATE
APP: The name's agent APPLEJUICE. They call me that, well, I love APPLEJUICE.
APP: (sits on detective chair) My mission? To track down and solve cases of sock theft.
APP: Let us say that you have a missing sock amongst all your piles of laundry.
APP: Who does it? Sock stealing monsters. Or maybe even your mistaken sibling or parent.
APP: Socks are meant to be in pairs, that's the law. I solve plenty of these cases, and I am certainly expecting more of this nonsense.
knocking on door
APP: Ah, another case, it's winter and it's cold outside. Whoever you are, you may come in.
KID: (Opens the door) Brrr. Hello, APPLEJUICE! Uh, my wonderful winter socks, one of them is missing!
APP: Ah, I see, how is it going on this fine January evening? How urgent is this case?
KID: My sock has been missing very recently. I also brought a friend of mine. May he come with me?
Meanwhile MON: (follow the kid to the door) Brrrrrrr....
MON: (shivering) It is cold out there! I even have a coat on, and I still feel myself freezing like a ICECREAM!
APP: Very well, come in and sit down. We shall investigate this case...
KID: Thank you so much APPLEJUICE! (Goes to sit down)
Meanwhile MON: (closes the door and follows the other kid)
APP: Can you please state your names?
KID: I am Jake
MON: And I'm his imaginary friend! A friendly monster!
APP: Let us first discuss the sock itself. Do you exactly know what the sock looked like before the pair got split?
KID: Well, I definitely know the sock was COLOR. COLOR is easy to distinguish from the scenery in my room.
scribbling
APP: (taking notes) Uh huh, and where did you last see it?
MON: I think the last time I saw it; it was in his room. I was moving around a couple things, and, yeah.
KID: (To the monster) Imaginary friend, look, I think it was in the ROOM. You shouldn't tell the detective any lies like that.
MON: Sorry.
APP: It is alright, any extra details on the sock that was stolen?
KID: Not that I could think of...
APP: Well then, this information is better than nothing. Who do you accuse of stealing your precious sock?
KID: (thinking) Hmmm... I think it was, SHOW!
MON: That is a pretty far-fetched guess there, buddy!
APP: Uhhh, SHOW? Hmmph! Impossible! SHOW is only confined to the TV dimensions. There is no way it can be...
TV: (enters) Has anybody seen the COLOR sock I was looking for?

APP: Real... How did SHOW even get here?!
KID: (points to the TV character) There he is! He stole my sock!
TV: No, I didn't!
MON: Yes, you did!

KID: But- but SHOW has stolen my COLOR sock! Arrest him!
MON: I swear he is just trying to hide it from the rest of us...
Meanwhile TV: (angry) You are all telling lies, lies, I say, lies!
APP: (angry) I said settle down! Order in the court! Please!
Music Stops
MON: This is not a court session but thank you.
APP: Look, is there any way we can distinguish between the two socks?
KID: Oh wait, now I remember! How stupid I am. My sock has little pictures of SHAPEs on it!
TV: Mine was just a plain COLOR sock. Oh, how I fooled myself.
APP: Well then, case closed on that. So, if it's not SHOW, then, who did it?
MON: (nervously) Not me, no, why would I do that?
Meanwhile TV: Not me!
MON: (gasp) An unsolved mystery!

APP: I am afraid it came down to this. I will set out some suspects and a bounty hunt tomorrow morning.
KID: My friends always trust me with socks, please do not go after them!
APP: I am afraid we may have to if we do not find the sock stealer soon.

KNI: Something about not wasting your time?

VIL: I've stopped you from stopping me with only a few precautions in my plan!
KNI: Well little do YOU know wizard... I've also prepared for this exact situation!
KNI: My ADJ sidekick, as you would say, thought this would happen!
KNI: So we decided to outsmart you twice!
SIDE: That's right! We've stopped you by knowing that you would try to stop us from stopping you!
MIN: A lot of thought must have gone into your plans...
VIL: But not enough thought! As I have one more trick up my sleeve!
KNI: No... it's not possible...
SIDE: You don't mean...
MIN: (Sigh) Here we go...
VIL: That's right... as much as you have planned...
VIL: I've planned even more!
VIL: (Evil Laugh) In the end... I've stopped you from stopping me from stopping you from stopping me!

(courtroom music)
PROSECUTOR: So, taking into account all the evidence and testimony we have seen over the last TIME
PROSECUTOR: I believe I have provided sufficient proof that DEFNAME is guilty of MINCRIME.
JUDGE TERRI: Hmm... A compelling case from PRONAME. ATTNAME, your response?
ATTORNEY: Your honor, all PRONAME has done over these TIME is try to slander my clients good name.
PROSECUTOR: Objection! That's not true! I am trying to bring them to justice! Enough with your tall tales, ATTNAME!
ATTORNEY: Objection! Don't interrupt me while I am giving my closing arguments... that's rude.
JUDGE TERRI: Sustained, that was quite rude of you, PRONAME.
ATTORNEY: As I was saying, I believe the evidence I have shown proves why my client had no choice but to resort to MINCRIME.
ATTORNEY: DEFNAME is innocent and what they did was justified.
JUDGE TERRI: Hmm, another decent argument (Look at defendant) How do you plead, DEFNAME?
DEFENDANT: Not guilty your honor. I did what I did to get back at the GROUP. They had it coming.
JUDGE TERRI: Hmm, yes, the GROUP can be quite troublesome.
JUDGE TERRI: You know I like you, DEFNAME. You remind me of me in my youth, a bit of a loose cannon but a good man at heart.
JUDGE TERRI: We all screw up sometimes. I know I've certainly had my fair share of adventures.
DEFENDANT: Hunh, never though of you as that type, Judge.
JUDGE TERRI: Oh yes, there is much you don't know, but all that is irrelevant.
JUDGE TERRI: MINCRIME is still a crime, but given the circumstances, I think I'll go easy on you.
JUDGE TERRI: With that, I am ready to hand down my verdict. I declare DEFNAME
ATTORNEY: Hold on, your honor, how do you know about the GROUP?
PROSECUTOR: And what do you mean when you say 'my fair share of adventures'? Are you hiding something?
ATTORNEY: What are you suggesting, PRONAME?
PROSECUTOR: The judge seems sympatric to the defendants plight. What if he's committed MINCRIME in the past?
(courtroom sting)
ATTORNEY: (gasps and looks at judge) Your Honor! Surely it's not true!
JUDGE TERRI: (Nervous) N-No why would I do something like that? I'm an upstanding judge!
DEFENDANT: I don't know. The judge is looking pretty sus right now. I mean... (mutters) It takes one to know one.
PROSECUTOR: Admit it Judge Terri! You are guilty of MINCRIME and have no right to proceed with your judgement!
JUDGE TERRI: You're out of order, PRONAME! Cease this line of questioning at once!
JUDGE TERRI: Or I will will sentence you to PUNISHMENT!
ATTORNEY: Now I'm suspicious too. We should put you on trial for MINCRIME!
PROSECUTOR: I agree with ATTNAME. We'll find the truth! Even if it takes TIME.
JUDGE TERRI: This is Absurd! I Object!
DEFENDANT: (points at the judge) OVERULED! Sorry I've always wanted to say that.
ATTORNEY: We're the judges now, Judge Terri!
(shark tank discussion music 1)
PROSECUTOR: And my first witness is you (point at Judge Terri) Have you been guilty of MINCRIME?
JUDGE TERRI: (Growls) Okay Fine! Yes I admit it! I've indulged in MINCRIME once or maybe NUMBER times.
ATTORNEY: NUMBER Times!?
PROSECUTOR: You're a Monster!
DEFENDANT: Not even the GROUP deserves that.
JUDGE TERRI: It was years ago! And I got away with it every time too! Until you meddling lawyers and your stupid defendant came along!
JUDGE TERRI: What's the big deal!? It's Just MINCRIME!
JUDGE TERRI: At least I'm not doing anything really bad like MAJCRIME if I did that, then I would be in trouble.
DEFENDANT: Hold on now, that seems like a really specific offense, why would you just randomly bring it up like that?
DEFENDANT: Could it be that you're guilty of that too?
PROSECUTOR: Hmm... DEFNAME may have a point.
ATTORNEY: Have you also committed MAJCRIME, Judge Terri?
JUDGE TERRI: (Very nervous) N-N-No! Never I... I Object! AGAIN! This is a violation of uhh... something!
PROSECUTOR: You seem pretty shaken Judge Terri, why not just confess? Or do you want this to last TIME?
JUDGE TERRI: Fine! I shouldn't have said anything! But yes! I did it! I am guilty of MAJCRIME too!
(tense cinematic music)
ATTORNEY: Seriously!? How Did you get away with that!?
PROSECUTOR: I'm starting to wonder how you became a judge!
DEFENDANT: Wow, you're actually worse than me.
JUDGE TERRI: It's not my fault! The GROUP made me do it! I had no choice. It was years ago!
JUDGE TERRI: They were gonna make me PUNISHMENT if I didn't do what they said.
ATTORNEY: Save it for the judge, Judge!
PROSECUTOR: So not only are you guilty of MINCRIME, you're also guilty of MAJCRIME
PROSECUTOR: What else have you done, Judge Terri? If that even IS your real name!
JUDGE TERRI: There is nothing else. You've already exposed me as an evil criminal lunatic!
JUDGE TERRI: The only thing I haven't revealed is that time I got away with CRZCRIME.
(silly music 2)
JUDGE TERRI: WAIT! I mean I almost did that but I decided to be a good law abiding citizen!
DEFENDANT: How am I the one on trial with maniacs like this! (points at judge) Doing stuff like CRZCRIME!?
PROSECUTOR: You truly are disgusting. How do you keep getting away with it?
ATTORNEY: And how did you become a judge with such a bad track record?
JUDGE TERRI: (sighs) I have rich parents. My dad is a JOB.
ATTORNEY: Yep, That'll do it.
PROSECUTOR: That explains a lot.
DEFENDANT: It's always the ones with JOB parents.
ATTORNEY: So what's your excuse for CRZCRIME? Did the GROUP make you do that one too?
JUDGE TERRI: (defeated voice) No. That one was all me. I did it for THINGS.
PROSECUTOR: All for THINGS, hunh? Was it worth it?
JUDGE TERRI: Well considering I never actually got any THINGS, no not really.
ATTORNEY: What a sad way for the son of a JOB to go.
JUDGE TERRI: But now you actually know everything
JUDGE TERRI: Congratulations DEFNAME, ATTNAME and PRONAME.
JUDGE TERRI: You have exposed me for the villain I truly am. So... how long I am going away for?
PROSECUTOR: Well considering your crimes of MINCRIME
ATTORNEY: and MAJCRIME
DEFENDANT: and even CRZCRIME
PROSECUTOR: My math sees you spending about... NUMBER years in jail.
JUDGE TERRI: I see... Well in that case... YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE! (run off stage)
PROSECUTOR: Bailiff! Go after that madman!
DEFENDANT: So uhh... Am I off the hook. I did help catch that guy with you... kind of.
PROSECUTOR: No. We'll just move your hearing to another date with a different judge.
ATTORNEY: Yeah, it's very important you have a fair trial for MINCRIME
DEFENDANT: COME ON! Are you serious!?
TYPEWRITER: Judge Terri was never found. Some say he's still at large today.

JUDGE: Before we start, I'd like to ask The Wizard a few questions.
WIZARD: Ask away, your honor.
JUDGE: It was my understanding that you were being represented by a lawyer.
JUDGE: Where are they?
WIZARD: Just like one of you mortals to not understand the machinations of my mind.

WIZARD: Yes, your honor, I would be happy to tell you my side of this case.
WIZARD: This little bag of GROSS stole my Tarot Cards, thinking it was a super rare collectible from some childish game he indulges in!
NERD: You told me it was a powerful card that could deflect Divine attacks and reflect them on your enemy.
WIZARD: Yes, in real life, you smooth-brained toad.
LAWYER: (Whispering to Tommy) Look, kid, I don't think it's a good idea to provoke him like that.
JUDGE: (Hits the gavel) Order! Order in the court.
JUDGE: Now we want this to be a calm and fair case. That means NO MORE FIGHTING in my court. Do you understand?
NERD: Yes, your honor.
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Reluctantly) Yes, your honor.
JUDGE: Now, Tommy and LNAME, I'd like you to CALMLY state your case.
LAWYER: Thank you, your honor. Now let’s go through the events from my client's side of the story.
LAWYER: It starts at 2:00 p.m. on January 10th. My client was looking for some new cards for his collection.
LAWYER: He came across a listing for some cards that The Wizard was selling and decided to buy them.
LAWYER: The Wizard unknowingly had the "Divine Reflection" card in there as well and sold it to my client.
WIZARD: Objection! I had my card safe in my vault as always when this happened.
JUDGE: Objection overruled. Please continue, LNAME.
LAWYER: Thank you, your honor.
LAWYER: As I was saying, my client bought the cards and was then harassed for the next week as The Wizard turned his friends into ANIMALS.
JUDGE: Do either of you have any proof for your claims?
LAWYER: No he turned the witnesses into ANIMALS
Meanwhile WIZARD: Uhh... no...
JUDGE: Well, if there isn’t any proof for either claim, there’s only one thing to do.

PERSON: I prefer my blood to pump inside of my body. I'll take my Snickerdoodle to go, thanks.
HOSTILE: Nope, Nope, Nuh-uh-uh-uh, No way. You ain't leaving that easily. Back me up, already.
PERSON: (sigh).. If the floor is sand, you don't need to worry about the blood on the..
PERSON: ..Actually, no.. Alright, listen. Hear me out here.
PERSON: ACTIVITY. All of the thrill, None of the murder!
LEADER: Oooh...
HOSTILE: (Stay silent for a bit) No.
LEADER: I don't know, I find the idea quite charming!
(jazz music 2)
PERSON: Why, thank you.
LEADER: And there would be no need to build an additional venue to facilitate it! We have ample room in here!
LEADER: I could have ORGANIZER whip us up a lovely banner.. Hand out some pamphlets...
HOSTILE: I cannot believe you are taking this seriously.
LEADER: (Thinking) Hmmm...
PERSON: Oh! I know! How about, like, a one-night-a-month event where we pick random songs and maybe try to do like a dance-off?
heavy door knocking
HOSTILE: (SLAM HEAD ON TABLE) Urrgh..
Music stops
HOSTILE: I'm going to die.
HOSTILE: You're going to find me one day under a table with a little message etched into the blade of the WEAPON you won't let me use
HOSTILE: and all It will say is "Here lies the only Rational one. Died of Boredom"
LEADER: (Short laugh) ...I'm sorry, But I'm afraid I will have to continue to veto the idea of a ARENA.
LEADER: For one thing, all ethical concerns aside, Trying to get planning permission for that sort of thing would be an unending nightmare.
LEADER: Plus, For the other concern, I can't help but feel like you would end up... Killing all of our customers.
LEADER: Am I wrong?
HOSTILE: ...No
LEADER: I didn't think so. I know it's a drag, but you'll have to find some other way to entertain yourself.
HOSTILE: ...Fine.
HOSTILE: (Walks off stage) I'll figure something out.
LEADER: (Looks at PERSON) So!
(noir music 1)
LEADER: (Sit down on a nearby chair) Now that we have a minute, How are you settling in?
LEADER: We have very little idea of how to provide creature comforts,
LEADER: But I'm told the establishment has a cozy quality these days!
PERSON: It's uh... Yeah, Cozy's one word for it, Did you guys set up all the scrap metal walls and stuff in the hallways?
LEADER: No, that was not our handiwork. The last group before you, actually. Lovely bunch! Certainly raised a few eyebrows, though.
LEADER: I mean, It's not often you see a-
LEADER: Well. Hm. I'm not sure this is my story to tell, honestly.
PERSON: C'mon, man. You can't just drop that and not follow through, you're leaving me hanging over here!
LEADER: Like I said, not my story to tell.
PERSON: Really. I'm not, like AUTHORITY, Even if those guys did weird things, Who's gonna stop them now?
LEADER: It's not anything particularly scandalous, Just a silly thing, No AUTHORITY will really care.
LEADER: But I feel kind of.. petty talking about it behind their backs.
LEADER: Honestly? I don't think I've ever met such a cheery, energetic bunch. They clearly loved spending time with each other.
LEADER: They didn't even really seem fazed by the fact that they randomly just started living here for factors outside of their own control.
PERSON: How do you mean? HOMELESS? Job, Like, Co-workers? Forced relocation?
LEADER: None of the above, More like a "I must have taken the wrong turn, But I like the view" kind of deal.
Meanwhile HOSTILE: (Get ready behind the door)
PERSON: Hey, I'm sure you guys did what you could in terms of assistance, you know - with the resources, food and HEALTH.
LEADER: Oh, and another thing. Can you do me a favour and check on the "Sane one"?

PERSON: Check on the "Sane one", done..
LEADER: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE! (Run through the now opened door)
HOSTILE: Well, Better follow him, NAME. Go, help us!

HOSTILE: (Wait till they're gone) Welp, Time to steal all the snickerdoodles while those two idiots are away. Heheheh... Like candy from a baby..

peaceful fantasy music
ROYAL: Alright! Our journey to save KINGDOMNAME is nearly complete, faithful servant!
SERVANT: (distraught) Sire, that's what you’ve been saying for the past 3 DAYS NOW.
ROYAL: True… BUT! This time around, it’ll be DIFFERENT! I can feel it!
SERVANT: You’ve ALSO said THAT the other times as well!
ROYAL: Relax, man! Once we find the guy we’re looking for, It’ll be smooth sailing from this point onwards.
SERVANT: (scornfully) I still can’t believe you spent ALL of your gold on some crummy TRINKET at that store we went to yesterday!
ROYAL: (defensively) Hey! The store clerk told me that TRINKET would bring me great luck, and it would aid us on our quest to save KINGDOMNAME.
SERVANT: I could understand if it was, lets say, a MAGICAL TRINKET, perhaps. But it’s quite literally just a regular old TRINKET, sire!
SERVANT: (angrily) Plus, we’ve had nothing BUT bad luck ever since you got that useless thing!
ROYAL: Those wild CREATUREs really can pack a punch! I’m surprised we made it out of there alive!
SERVANT: (sigh) Barely… they ate all of our MEAL(s)!
ROYAL: Now, getting back to the task at hand. We gotta find some guy in the woods who will give us what we need to save KINGDOMNAME.
ROYAL: What did those directions say to do again?
SERVANT: Let me reach into my pocket and find them… (pulling out directions from pocket) Aha! Let’s see…
SERVANT: (reading aloud) “The Vendor of EVILFOREST can be found within the heart of the woods.”
Meanwhile VENDOR: (Get ready to enter)
SERVANT: “For those brave or ADJECTIVE enough to find him, ask ONLY about his wares.” Huh… how very ominous.
Meanwhile VENDOR: (Get ready to enter!)
Music Stops
forest footstep
VENDOR: (Enter with MANIACAL LAUGHTER and stare down travelers for a moment)
Meanwhile ROYAL: (Be startled by the laughter and hide behind Servant)
VENDOR: (Cheerily) GREETINGS, you ADJECTIVE NOUNs!
halloween music
VENDOR: I couldn’t help but overhear your insolent YAPPING from the other side of the EVILFOREST.
VENDOR: Some CREATUREs told me that you ADJECTIVE NOUNs seek… (dramatically) the Vendor of EVILFOREST, CORRECT?
ROYAL: (Amazed) Woahhhh. Spot on! How’d you know?
VENDOR: Word gets around KINGDOMNAME VERY quickly. (ominously) Plus, I’ve got eyes and ears all around the forest. (MANIACAL LAUGHTER)
ROYAL: That sounds very convenient! (To Servant) Hey! Maybe this guy knows where we can find this vendor!
SERVANT: (hesitantly) I don’t think we should talk to this person, sire. Something about them doesn’t sit right with me.
ROYAL: (earnestly) How so?
SERVANT: Well, for starters he called us “ADJECTIVE NOUNs”.
ROYAL: So? “ADJECTIVE NOUN” was my nickname back in school!
SERVANT: You’ve been quite the ADJECTIVE NOUN thus far on our journey.
ROYAL: Hmm… (inspecting the vendor) He just looks so… normal though. I trust him!
VENDOR: I’m definitely not a demon or some CREATUREs in a clever disguise. That would be RIDICULOUS!
SERVANT: (To Royal) Sire, just listen to what they’re saying!
VENDOR: When I’m not roaming around in EVILFOREST, I like to DOEVIL!
Vine boom
SERVANT: See! They’re clearly evil.
ROYAL: Let’s not jump to conclusions so fast!
ROYAL: Maybe… they’re just a lonely person, living in the woods with the CREATUREs, who likes to DOEVIL in their spare time!
SERVANT: (befuddled at Royal) …what?
ROYAL: I’m sure tons of people like to DOEVIL! They just don’t know it yet!
VENDOR: My personal hobbies aside, you two ADJECTIVE NOUNs are looking for the Vendor of EVILFOREST, yes?
VENDOR: Well… Look NO further, for you have found them!
thunder
ROYAL: (unaware) Awesome! Where are they?
VENDOR: (Angrily pointing) I AM the vendor, you ADJECTIVE NOUN!
ROYAL: (realizing) Servant… I think this guy’s the Vendor we’ve been searching for!
SERVANT: (facepalm) Oh boy…
ROYAL: (dramatically) Oh, mystical Vendor of EVILFOREST! We come seeking your wares on our quest to save KINGDOMNAME!
VENDOR: How may I assist you?
ROYAL: (casually) You got any TRINKETs?
VENDOR: NO. When in life would you EVER need a TRINKET? They’re useless!
SERVANT: That’s what I told him!
ROYAL: Well… what about a MEAL? Some CREATUREs stole all our food on the way here.
SERVANT: (agreeing) I could go for a MEAL right about now…
VENDOR: I don’t have a MEAL, however, I DO have this TOTALLY SAFE FRUIT I can sell you.
ROYAL: Delicious! Wait… where’d you get that FRUIT from?
VENDOR: (dismissively) uhhhhh… locally grown, here in EVILFOREST of course! My personal number one seller!
VENDOR: (nudging Royal) Reviews say my FRUIT is to DIE for! Really ‘da BOMB’! EXPLODING with flavour!
vine boom
ROYAL: Sounds good! We’ll take two FRUITs please!
VENDOR: Coming right up! (Grab FRUITs from pockets and hand them to Royal) Here you go, Your Royal NOUNness.
Meanwhile ROYAL: (put hands out take the FRUITs, and give one to Servant)
SERVANT: (sniffing the FRUIT) Hmm… something about this FRUIT smells off, sire.
ROYAL: (sniffing your FRUIT) smells fine to me! Stop worrying so much, dude.
ROYAL: How much do we owe you?
VENDOR: Since you’re of royal blood… I'll give it to you for FREE!
SERVANT: This whole thing is awfully suspicious, I’m not eating this FRUIT.
ROYAL: Well I am! I trust that this lovely vendor has only the best of intentions!
VENDOR: Yes! Dismiss your servant! Bite into the FRUIT! Do it!
ROYAL: (bite into FRUIT) Mmmm. Yummers! Tastes kinda like a MEAL!

Teleport ROYAL to BACKSTAGE
VENDOR: (Triumphantly) YES!!!!! I'VE DONE IT! AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!

SERVANT: I knew it! You’re evil!
VENDOR: Now that the last of the royals has been dealt with, I can claim the throne!
SERVANT: You’ll never get away with this!
VENDOR: KINGDOMNAME is as good as mine! (Maniacal Laughter!)

Music Stops
VENDOR: No! Impossible! (fall dead on ground)

Teleport VENDOR to BACKSTAGE
ROYAL: (enter stage) E-yikes! That was a close one!
tada
SERVANT: SIRE!? But… But HOW!?
happy music 1
ROYAL: It seems the FRUIT’s explosion had only temporarily knocked me out!
SERVANT: Wow. That thick skull of yours was finally useful!
ROYAL: Not bad for a ADJECTIVE NOUN, huh?
ROYAL: Also, remember that TRINKET?
SERVANT: Yeah? What about it?
ROYAL: Turns out that TRINKET wasn’t a TRINKET at all!
ROYAL: It was a gun, SHAPED like a TRINKET! Crazy, right!?
SERVANT: Yeah. Well, I’m glad you’re alright, sire, but what about KINGDOMNAME!?
ROYAL: Oh right! I’m sure it’ll work out in the end.
ROYAL: (Very Cheesily) Man, that guy was quite “The Royal Pain” ™.
SERVANT: (slowly turn to royal) …ARE YOU FOR REAL RIGHT NOW!?

matt: Wait... are you... an alien?
jack: And a drunk one at that! You okay, mate?
zorp norp: Oi, you got DRINK in there? I’m dying for a drink!
matt: You just crashed your spaceship into the Outback and now you want our DRINK?
zorp norp: Yeah, I’ve been traveling for ages. A man—well, alien—needs a DRINK, right? Just one little sip... come on.
jack: Mate, you’re a walking disaster. I bet your spaceship’s still burning out there.
zorp norp: It’ll be fine! I’ll fix it later. Just need to have a DRINK, settle the nerves, y’know?
matt: You’re not getting a DRINK.
zorp norp: Oh, come on, fellas! Just SIPSS more sips mate. Look at it! It’s all icy and... oh yeah. (grabs a DRINK and opens it with his teeth) Perfect.
matt: You’re already hammered! You can’t just keep drinking!
zorp norp: Ahhh, that’s the stuff! This is the best DRINK I’ve had since I... uh, I don’t know, crashed into a moon last week. But this... this is next level.
jack: This is insane. We’re out here in the middle of PLACE, and you’re just making yourself at home.
zorp norp: Oi, I’m not just making myself at home. I’m fixing things up! (stumbles toward the fire) Look at this little campfire. I’ll make it better!
matt: Wait, no—don’t mess with that!

Zorp Norp: Oops! (knocks over the campfire while trying to "fix" it. The fire spills out.)
jack: Oi, you idiot! You just knocked it over!
zorp norp: No worries, mate! I’m an expert! I’ve been to Mars, Venus... you name it! This fire’s nothing. I’ll fix it in a sec. Just need another DRINK!
matt: You’re gonna PHYSICAL the whole bloody place down!
zorp norp: It’ll be fine! It’s all part of the process. (stumbles back to the cooler)
jack: Mate, you’ve officially turned this into a nightmare. You can’t just keep drinking our stuff!
zorp norp: What? I’m helping! Look at me go! This is a classic zorp norp move.
matt: That’s what you need to fix, not the fire. Your ship’s still on fire, mate!
zorp norp: Nah, nah, I’ll get to it later. Just need... a few more DRINK first. I’m seriously under-fueled.
jack: You’re under everything, mate. But if you want to pass out here and leave us to deal with this, go for it.
zorp norp: You got any more DRINK, though? ‘Cause... this would be a good time for that.
matt: Oh, great. Now you want more DRINK. No way. You’ve already raided the DRINK.
zorp norp: Oh come on, I promise I’ll leave you some... just a sip. I’ll be on my way... eventually.
jack: You’ve got a one-way ticket to sleepville in about five minutes, mate. You’re done.
zorp norp: Fine... just one more... (passes out)
vine boom

matt: Well, he’s done. What now?
jack: I guess we wait for him to wake up... or just leave him here and pretend we didn’t meet him.

QUACK: Actually, there are a couple of funny things happen in a CHIROPRACTOR's, you could probably use them in your next sketch.
WRITER: (Sit up enthusiastically) Seriously?!
QUACK: (Sheepishly) Well... you probably have people suggesting things all the time.
WRITER: (Taking out a notepad and pen) Oh, I wish! I'm really stuck for ideas, what've you got?

WRITER: COCCYX! Of course, yes! Sounds like COCCYX! There's a laugh in that.

BEN: Doctor, I've come down with something, but I've never felt like this before, BOO!
BEN: I didn't wanna go out in case I gave it to anyone else, BOO!
DOCTOR: I see. I will have to do some examinations. Don't get up.
DOCTOR: (Rummaging in your bag) First, I'm just going to stick my LOLLIPOP in your mouth. Say aaah.
BEN: Aaah! BOO!
Meanwhile DOCTOR: (Put your LOLLIPOP in BEN's mouth)
DOCTOR: Hmm, nothing unusual there. Okay, I'm going to take your temperature.

BEN: Ooh! Aah! BOO! Be gentle, doc!
Meanwhile DOCTOR: (Insert the thermometer in BEN's EAR)
DOCTOR: Oh dear, your temperature is a bit high.
DOCTOR: How long have you been saying BOO for?
BEN: (Sitting up on the couch) Since about MIDNIGHT THREE days ago. BOO!
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has your EAR had that rash on it?
BEN: Uh, only since Tuesday. BOO!
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm afraid all your symptoms point to that new fever that's going round, DIABEETUS.

BEN: DIABEETUS?! BOO?!
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it is. You were right not to come to the surgery to see me. DIABEETUS is a very contagious infection.
DOCTOR: Of course, I've been vaccinated against DIABEETUS so I'm perfectly fine.
BEN: What should I do, Doc? BOO!
DOCTOR: Three things. First, I'll give you this CREAM to put on your EAR. (hand it over)
Meanwhile BEN: (Take the CREAM)
DOCTOR: Second, you need to drink plenty of fluids. THREE litres of WATER a day until the symptoms subside.
BEN: Where on Earth will I get THREE litres of WATER? BOO!
DOCTOR: (Point to the kitchen) Try the hot tap.
DOCTOR: And finally, do not, under any circumstances, invite any friends over for DND.
BEN: Why not, Doc? BOO!

PLINK: Or something hilarious! Like “The MEME_ANIMAL Squad”!
WIZARD: Let’s start with some ideas. MAD, you first.

HADRON: Boring. How about “The Shadows of MEME_VERB”?
MAISY: Or... “The WEIRD_FOOD Lovers”?

HADRON: It’s missing something... like, a dark twist. dark as MEME_COLOR
PLINK: Or a punchline! like FAKE_CELEBRITY
WIZARD: What if we add “Ultra” to the front?
MAD: “Ultra VIRAL_ADJECTIVE WEIRD_FOOD MEME_VERB MEME_ANIMAL”! It’s perfect!
MAISY: Ultra chill.

SCRIPT ==========================================
World news intro
BLAKE: Good evening, I’m Blake Carter.
LISA: And I’m Lisa Monroe. And this is KCOC News, where we bring you the news honestly, accurately, and without any personal vendettas.
LISA: Unlike some people, who bring you lies, deceit, and emotional damage every weeknight.
BLAKE: Our top story tonight: a news anchor has been charged with breaking the heart of a beloved, reputable colleague.
BLAKE: And yet somehow they posted bail immediately after serving time in the fiery pits of Hell.
LISA: Sources say this may be a case of mistaken identity, as the real suspect is actually a deadbeat dad, who fathers NUMBER children.
LISA: And this just in, he reportedly owes a Fort Knox ton of CURRENCY in child support.
BLAKE: Speaking of financial responsibility, a local gold digger in a loose-fitting RETAILSTORE dress was spotted on a date.
BLAKE: With an alleged investment banker. At least some financial markets still have stability.
LISA: And in other news, a local loser was seen once again drinking alone at IRISHPUB after realizing he already drank all his lonely tears.
LISA: Witnesses say he spent the evening ranting to the bartender and a OCCUPATION about how “some people just can’t commit.”
BLAKE: In political news, the President of FCOUNTRY has announced a new economic plan.
BLAKE: A plan focused on cutting back unnecessary expenses, something a certain female colleague is reportedly unfamiliar with.
BLAKE: Experts say she booked a luxury spa weekend in VSPOT, presumably to wash away the guilt of her bad life choices.
LISA: Mmm. Fascinating. Speaking of bad choices, a recent study has shown that male shortcomings are real, measurable, and widely acknowledged.
LISA: The study confirms that men who wear drugstore cologne named ANIMAL Instinct tend to overcompensate.
LISA: Scientists say this behavior is common among those who recently purchased a sad, little CARTYPE, despite having no discernible income.
BLAKE: (exhales) Let’s check in with Carlos for sports.
CARLOS: Please don't.
BLAKE: Carlos, would you say Lisa’s dating life is like the SPORTSTEAM -- always making promises, never delivering, and constantly fumbling?
CARLOS: I think I’d rather just talk about sports.
LISA: (smug) Ah. So you’d know a thing or two about choke artists who choke under pressure.
CARLOS: And let’s check in on the weather with Ron. Ron, uh… help me out here?
RON: (muttering) Why me? Okay, weather! We have an icy cold front moving in from VSPOT.
RON: Eerily similar to the cold, unfeeling heart of an INSECT with a weave.
CARLOS: (Or the unfeeling heart of someone who once said, “I just need space,” but was seen kissing NUMBER men the next day.
BLAKE: Booyah!
LISA: (sarcastic) Wow, this is going great. I’m now being told by producers that massive layoffs are taking place after this very broadcast.
BLAKE: The only ones affected are Lisa's multiple personalities.
LISA: Well, that’s our report. Thanks for watching KCOC News. where we report the facts, except for the ones Blake conveniently forgets.
BLAKE: And where we keep America informed, even when some people choose to lie through their teeth and still pretend they're a virgin.
CARLOS: Do I still get to talk about baseball or?
BLAKE: Good night.
LISA: Good night.

LYN: That’s not entirely true, there’s your job at COMPANY
LOGAN: That’s not an actual job, it’s an internship.
LYN: It’s still a job, besides, I’m surprised you actually accepted this one with me.
LYN: Ya know, with it being acting and all.
LOGAN: Gotta make rent money somehow Lyn.

LYN: I’m not quite sure.

DIRECTOR: (Enter stage right) Ahhhh, Hello there I hadn’t expected any one to be out here so early.
LYN: Who are you?
DIRECTOR: I am NAME, play-writer and director, and you are.
LYN: I’m Lyn and that’s Logan, I take it this is your ad.(hand over paper)
DIRECTOR: Ah yes, so that make you my actors, wonderful
LOGAN: Uh, Mr. NAME, You mind telling me why we are doing this in the forest and not a studio.
DIRECTOR: Because my dear boy, this place is where i am most MIND.
LOGAN: But you could see how it could be seen as sketch, right?
DIRECTOR: Now that you mention it, yes, yes I do.
DIRECTOR: In any case(Handout packets), here are the scripts, I wrote them myself.
Meanwhile LOGAN:(Flip through the pages)
LOGAN: This is just a Romeo and Julliet ripoff.
DIRECTOR: (Gasps in disbelief) NO IT IS NOT!
DIRECTOR: It is an original work, called, Uh, Um, "GENERIC-BOY & GENERIC-GIRL”.
LOGAN: No it's not, the third act is word for word Shakespeare.
LYN: (Quietly) shut up Logan, I’m sure they worked really hard on this script.
LOGAN: (Quietly back) I'm pretty sure the hardest part of this was reading the original.
( Emotional Piano Music)
DIRECTOR: Fine, you caught me, it’s true, It’s all plagiarized, I am but a failure.
LYN: Do you want to talk about it?
DIRECTOR: Yeah.
LYN: Then go ahead and start from the beginning.
DIRECTOR: It all started when my parents met.
LOGAN: Not that beginning, the one where you began writing.
DIRECTOR: Oh, sorry.
DIRECTOR: When I was young, I had a dream, to be the best play-write there ever was.
DIRECTOR: Unfortunately, I had not a single creative BODYPART. Thus, I could not write an original screenplay.
LOGAN: So then you had the idea to disguise someone else’s work as your own and hope no one would notice.
DIRECTOR: Precisely, But you saw through the guise, so now I’ll never make it.
LYN: If you want, we can still do the play, just give proper credit, and just tell everyone that it's your retelling instead of an 100% original.
DIRECTOR: You mean it?
LYN: Absolutely.
DIRECTOR: Ok, thank you.
LYN: No problem
(Happy music 1)
DIRECTOR: Now that we got that taken care of, we have a play to perform.
LYN: Are we not going to rehearse?
DIRECTOR: Nope, we are going to do it live
LYN: Wait a sec, the ad said nothing about a live audience.
DIRECTOR: Do you wanna make AMOUNT PAYMENT or not?
LOGAN: Oh ho hoo, you don’t say?
LYN: You can’t be serious Logan.
LOGAN: Come on Lyn, think about it, AMOUNT PAYMENT.
LYN: Fine, but it better be a 50/50 split.
LOGAN: I can work with that.
DIRECTOR: I assume the two of you are in agreement?
LOGAN: You’ve got yourself a deal, when do we start?

OWN: Maybe I should tell ya a story. Sit down and get comfy.
TOM: (sits down on couch)
OWN: A couple of years ago, it made a tick that got really annoying. I basically ignored it. Didn't even take it to a shop. Somehow it went away and ran fine.
TOM: No way.
OWN: I took out it's engine, dropped it off PLACE, drowned it in water for days, placed it in the trunk...
TOM: And did it run?
OWN: I even jammed FOOD into the gas tank. It still ran with one turn of the key! I don't think your ideal CAR could even do that!
vine boom
TOM: I'm not that insane.
OWN: This car is so solid, it'll even outlive your kids. It's already old enough to vote, consent, and even rent their own CAR
TOM: Oh, dear...
OWN: This got history in it's age. Seen stuff you won't believe, had stuff done in it you won't believe.
OWN: Kids, adult acts, mafia stuff. Stuff you probably can't do in a CAR and it won't judge you like one.
TOM: You're right, I probably won't like that...
OWN: I know it ain't a looker. When this was shown at the '98 CITY Auto Show, people yawned.
OWN: But this has enough personality that I even got it to fill out a favorites survey.
TOM: Alright, then. What's it's favorite snack?
OWN: FOOD
TOM: Favorite show?
OWN: SHOW
TOM: Music?
OWN: Tied between BAND1 and BAND2
TOM: Um... OK?
OWN: Trust me, this car is solid.
OWN: Practical like a retirement fund. Middle of the road like a fork. Strict like a member of the church.
OWN: Even the CarFax on this was simply. “Your car is just fine.”
TOM: I guess I won't mind a practical car.
OWN: I know it ain't pretty, but don't lie to yourself.
OWN: You're not gonna win any contests with this but you won't care, as long as it carries you from A to B.
OWN: It's not the CAR you want, but this is the car you deserve.

TOM: You know what? (stands up)
OWN: Hm?
TOM: I'm convinced. I'll take it.
OWN: I knew you see things my way. You got yourself a deal!
tada
TYPEWRITER: A year or two later, the car finally broke down, and Tom had enough in SITE subs and donors to get his own CAR.
TYPEWRITER: He kept a photo of it to honor “Ol' Reliable.”

WAITER: Good evening, sir! May I start you off with a complimentary appetizer?
CUSTOMER: Oh, how generous! Yes, I’d love that.

WAITER: Wonderful! It’s on the house — just a tiny favor in return.
CUSTOMER: (suspicious) What’s the catch? Want me to leave a review on WEBSITE?
WAITER: Wait. WEBSITE? No, that's not necessary. It's nothing major!
WAITER: Just that, at some point tonight, you must loudly whisper the phrase, “THE RNOUN KNOWS TOO MUCH."
WAITER: And then run to the bathroom as if you’re being chased.
CUSTOMER: Oh, is that some sort of comedy bit for SOCIALMEDIA? Sounds funny.
WAITER: What's SOCIALMEDIA?
CUSTOMER: Well, sure. Weird, but sure.
WAITER: Fantastic. Now, for your entrée, we have a special tonight. Would you like a free FOODITEM?
CUSTOMER: Free FOODITEM? As long as I can't choke on it, of course!
WAITER: Excellent choice! In exchange, you’ll simply need to stare at another customer for NUMBER minutes.
WAITER: And slowly nod like you share a deep, unspoken secret.
CUSTOMER: That's a long time to just stare at someone. Maybe a little creepy.
WAITER: Oh no, you wouldn't be staring into their eyes, just their BODYPART.
CUSTOMER: That's even worse.
WAITER: We can make it shorter! Just hum the SHOWNAME theme under your breath the whole time.
CUSTOMER: I mean, I guess there's no harm in doing that for free FOODITEM. So, okay, I guess.
WAITER: Oh! Would you care for a free glass of DRINKTYPE?
CUSTOMER: Let me guess — another bizarre condition?
WAITER: If you accept the wine, you must, at some point during your meal, stand up and tap your glass.
CUSTOMER: That sounds normal enough.
WAITER: And announce, “I'd like to make a toast to my ex-wife, who divorced me and married MALECELEB."
WAITER: And "Stella, my restaurant is doing so much better after all those ritual sacrifices."
CUSTOMER: You know what? Fine. Free DRINKTYPE, free FOODITEM — let's do it.
WAITER: That's the spirit! Now, might I interest you in a complimentary DESSERT?
CUSTOMER: It's okay, actually. I'll just pay for it.
WAITER: In that case, I can give you NUMBER percent off.
WAITER: You'll need to remove your CLOTHING, hold it up high, and whisper, “THE PROPHECY OF THE RNOUN HAS BEGUN.”
CUSTOMER: Absolutely not! That’s where I draw the line.
WAITER: Totally understandable. We also have a free chocolate mousse.
CUSTOMER: Give it to the customer behind me, and have them traumatized for life.
WAITER: Only catch is, you must sigh deeply, shake your head, and mutter, “Hope this doesn't taste like the last customer I had,” before taking your first bite.
CUSTOMER: You know what? I’ll just pay for my meal.
WAITER: Very well, sir. That will be NUMBER thousand dollars.
CUSTOMER: Give me the free stuff.

MAGICIAN: Phew. After selling SOLD ITEMS, I finally got enough to move to CITY and set up my fortune-telling shop.
MAGICIAN: (Looking up) The stars told me that I'd have a fateful meeting here. (Determined) I'll make you proud, ROLE MODEL.
FRIEND A: (Enter stage left) So anyway, then I tell her, "Nuh-uh! Ten times is enough! No more ADDICTION!"
Meanwhile FRIEND B: (Enter stage left with Friend A.)
MAGICIAN: Oh, ADDICTION? Jeez, I wish I could do that too. Never mind. Can't pass up this opportunity. (Wave down the two friends.) Hey there, sweethearts!
FRIEND A: "Sweethearts"? Us?
Meanwhile FRIEND B: (Look at the fortune teller.)
MAGICIAN: Yep! You two want a tarot reading? (Temptingly) Maybe get a chance to see how your love life is going to shape up?
FRIEND A: Hmm, love, huh? How much for your services?
FRIEND B: Don't tell me you believe in this mumbo-jumbo.
FRIEND A: C'mon, lighten up. It might be fun.
MAGICIAN: The first one's free.
FRIEND B: Fine. You know I can't pass up free stuff.
MAGICIAN: Alright, then time for a tarot reading! Here, pick a card. Any card!
FRIEND A: Okay, how about this one?
MAGICIAN: The Lovers! You're in love! Congratulations!
(Silly music 1)
FRIEND B: What? Is that all?
MAGICIAN: Yeah. Like I said, the first one's free. Every card after that is AMOUNT each.
FRIEND A: Ah, what the hell. Why not. Here. (Give cash to the fortune teller.)
MAGICIAN: One... two... AMOUNT. Great! Pleasure doing business with you.
FRIEND B: This better be worth it.
Meanwhile FRIEND A: (Pick another card.)
MAGICIAN: Wait a minute, this can't be right...
FRIEND A: Is something wrong?
MAGICIAN: Uh, your second card is The Wheel of Fortune! It's about going through changes.
FRIEND B: (Skeptical) Is that right?
MAGICIAN: (Talking to self) What would ROLE MODEL do, what would ROLE MODEL do...
FRIEND A: Okay, and the next card?
MAGICIAN: Oh, uh, FAKE TAROT! (uncertain) Yeah, it's, uh, it's about... going through changes and...
Meanwhile PICKPOCKET: (Enter Stage Right, walk behind the friends then start walking away)
MAGICIAN: Going through changes, and, and...
Meanwhile FRIEND B: (Check your pockets.) Hey, hold on just a moment...
MAGICIAN: If I remember right, FAKE TAROT means... death?
FRIEND A: Now, I may not be all that good at tarot, but something seems real fishy here...
MAGICIAN: Fishy!? Do I look like a fish to you?
FRIEND B: (Point at the pickpocket.) Hey! That creep stole my STOLEN ITEM!
PICKPOCKET: What'd you say? (Return to the group.)
FRIEND B: You stole my STOLEN ITEM! I want it back NOW!
Meanwhile MAGICIAN: (Turn away from the audience.)
PICKPOCKET: That's a serious accusation you're making, pumpkin. Where's your evidence?
FRIEND B: Evidence? I can't believe this! Turn out your pockets now!
MAGICIAN: Sorry, is this your STOLEN ITEM? (Turn and show the STOLEN ITEM to the Friends.)

MAGICIAN: The DEPARTMENT? I don't have the slightest idea what you mean.

JOURNALIST1: (Enter stage left) Hello.
Meanwhile JOURNALIST2: (Enter stage left) Greetings.
SPOKESPERSON: Hello, my name is NAME2. Thank you everyone for coming today, it's with a heavy heart that I stand here today before you.
SPOKESPERSON: It goes without saying why this conference needed to happen, but first there are some things I need to say before we move on to questions.
SPOKESPERSON: First off, on behalf of our company, I need to apologize for what happened earlier this week, we are sorry.
SPOKESPERSON: Not just me, but also everyone in our COMPANY family that had a hand in this.
SPOKESPERSON: This is an organizational error, and the fault lies with not just me, but everyone involved.
SPOKESPERSON: It is important that we exercise reason and restraint in the wake of EVENT, and control our emotions.
SPOKESPERSON: I will now take questions.
JOURNALIST1: (Raise hand) Question over here.
SPOKESPERSON: (Point) Go ahead.
JOURNALIST1: NAME1, Nosey Neighbours. So you're saying there were multiple parties involved in EVENT?
SPOKESPERSON: Well, yes. This was not something that I had exclusive control over, there were a lot of fingers in the OBJECT, so to speak.
JOURNALIST2: (Raise hand) I have a question as well.
SPOKESPERSON: (Point) Ah, yes, go ahead.
JOURNALIST2: Arthur C. All, PAPER1. Some people are worried this incident could be misconstrued as a crime.
JOURNALIST2: Is COMPANY not worried about the implications of CONSEQUENCE?
SPOKESPERSON: I understand your worry, but we've looked into this, and part of that crime is REASON.
SPOKESPERSON: We have all talked it over, and agreed that REASON was not involved in EVENT. It is clear to us that this was all an accident.
JOURNALIST1: (Raise hand) I have a question.
SPOKESPERSON: (Point) "Yes, NAME1, go ahead."
JOURNALIST1: You said earlier that the EVIDENCE investigators found on your person was related to your job, and not related to (EVENT) at all.
JOURNALIST1: Is that true? Is that still the story you're sticking with?
SPOKESPERSON: Well, the PLACE is a dirty place, and accidents happen. The fact that EVIDENCE was found on my person doesn't prove anything.
SPOKESPERSON: That's simply the way things go.
JOURNALIST2: (Raise hand) I have another question.
SPOKESPERSON: (Point) "Oh, yes, PAPER1."
JOURNALIST2: Are you sure you're not afraid of the special task force formed specifically to curb the number of these incidents?
JOURNALIST2: The investigator's report seemed pretty damning.

HEALER: Excuse me, is there a reason you're guarding this bridge?
GUARD: (Clear throat) Following the recent DISASTER, we have started taking tolls at checkpoints into the kingdom.
HEALER: I don't have money, do you two have money?
WARRIOR: Just this bag of MONSTER BODY PART 2.
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Turn away from the group, refusing to share money.)
GUARD: No money, hmm? Mighty strange. Any wanderer worth their salt would have money tucked away for such an eventuality.

GUARD: Unless you three are... (suspicious) SHAPESHIFTERS!?
HEALER: SHAPESHIFTERS? Do such things truly exist?
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Approach the healer.) Shh! Shh!

GUARD: (Look around like nothing happened.) Hmm.
WIZARD: (Attempting mind control) The toll has been paid. The three before you may enter and exit this checkpoint without further confrontation.

WIZARD: MONSTER's BODY PART 1! (To group) Don't worry. I can still salvage this.
WIZARD: Thou art hearing hallucinatory voices. 'tis a sign of delirium. Endeavor to take better care of thineself.
GUARD: I am taking perfectly good care of myself, I will have you know. EXCUSE 1 and everything.
WIZARD: EXCUSE 1... I see. In that case, wouldst thou like a helping of... (casting a spell) CHANT 2!?
GUARD: (Sigh) I really don't appreciate you throwing all that magic around.
WIZARD: (Casting more spells) CHANT 2! CHANT 2! It's... it's not working.
HEALER: Oh no. Don't worry. I'll use the goddess's blessing to charm the guard! (Approach guard.)
HEALER: (Sweetly) Hiiii! Could you let us pass? We're all tired and exhausted from a long day of fighting.
GUARD: No.
HEALER: (Sweetly) Pleaaaase?
GUARD: No means no.
HEALER: (To group) The goddess's blessing isn't working.
Meanwhile WARRIOR: Man, talk about a worthy foe.
HEALER: Are we sure this guard is human? Not one of those SHAPESHIFTERS?
WIZARD: (To guard) 'Tis plain to me that thou art an exceptional individual.
GUARD: Well, thanks. It's all due to the simple matter of EXCUSE 2.
WIZARD: EXCUSE 2. I see, I see. Could I tempt thee into an agreement?

GUARD: (To robot) Good morning.
ROBOT: Greetings.
GUARD: Good day for villainy, huh?
ROBOT: Current performance metrics are within acceptable parameters. "Good" is a sufficient description.
GUARD: Haha, yeah! You sure have a way with words. So anyway, I was wondering, are you doing anything after this shift?
ROBOT: Running the turn_left_and_right function until new directives are received.
GUARD: Nice, nice. Gotta love those directives. Hey, uh, if you're not busy, maybe we could go to PLACE sometime soon?
ROBOT: I am incredibly busy and will remain as such until I am decommissioned.
GUARD: Shucks. Can't blame a villain for trying. Alright, I'll see you again once I reach the end of my patrol route, alright?
(break down door)
AGENT: (Enter stage right, hide slightly) RANK. I've successfully infiltrated COMPOUND.
MEANWHILE Guard: (Slowly patrol to stage left.)
CONTROL: Great to hear it, CODENAME. I'm seeing a few blips on your radar. Can you tell me what you're seeing?
AGENT: (Peeking) Two tangoes. One guard, one robot.
CONTROL: Unmanned security robots... looks like ORGANIZATION's stepped up their game after the last incident.
CONTROL: You've got your GADGET with you, right? Press the four face buttons on your controller to equip it.
AGENT: That's a negative. I left it in the last game. I thought we wouldn't need it.
GUARD: (Turn around, face robot briefly) Hi again. Hey, uh, you wanna chat for a little? About, oh, I 'unno, TOPIC?
ROBOT: No. Please continue patrolling.
Meanwhile GUARD: (Slowly patrol to stage right.)
AGENT: (Hiding) Whatever. It's no big deal. I'll just collect 400 DISTRACTIONS again and get a new one.
CONTROL: Hate to be the bearer of bad news, CODENAME, but the reviewers didn't like it so we got rid of the collectables this time.
AGENT: Great. There's a guard coming this way, so what do I do?
Meanwhile GUARD: (Stop just shy of where the agent is hiding.)
CONTROL: Alright, let's go over the basics of spycraft, then. Approach from behind and press the INPUT to perform a silent takedown.
AGENT: I can't. They're looking right this way.
GUARD: (Turn to robot) Hey, do you hear that whispering?
ROBOT: I pretend not to.
AGENT: RANK. One of the guards has turned around. The robot's still watching. What do I do?
CONTROL: This is our chance, CODENAME. Approach the robot from behind and press the INPUT to hack it.
AGENT: Those are the same input? That sounds like it's going to be trouble later. (Sneak towards robot.)
(raygun shot)
CONTROL: I'm in their systems, CODENAME. What would you like me to do?
AGENT: What are my options?
CONTROL: I can make it explode and trip an alarm, disable its sensors for two seconds, make it attack other guards, or make it distract other guards.
AGENT: A distraction sounds really good right about now.
CONTROL: And... done!

ROBOT: (To guard) Hey, I've been thinking about that offer of yours...
GUARD: (Turn to robot) Oh? You want to go to PLACE with me?
ROBOT: Yeah, uh... Ever since I met you ten minutes ago... there's been this strange feeling in my...
GUARD: Yes? What is it?
Meanwhile ROBOT: I think... I think...

ROBOT: I think I love you.
GUARD: You love me? Why... this is incredible! Amazing! I'm so glad to hear you feel that way!

GUARD: (Look at agent) But who is this?
ROBOT: Oh, this is my friend, CODENAME!
AGENT: Friend? (To mission support) What're you doing?
CONTROL: What? I'm giving you a distraction.
AGENT: You made the robot introduce me as a friend while using my codename.
CONTROL: Look, the consumer market loves romance. It is completely out of my control. Just play along for now, okay?
(emotional piano music)
AGENT: Yeah, we were talking for a bit about TOPIC, and your name came up.
GUARD: You work here? I don't think I've ever seen you before.
AGENT: I do system penetration work. It's very complicated. Very boring. You wouldn't want to hear about it.
ROBOT: Yep. Not worth hearing for even a second.
AGENT: Point is, your friend here has overcome their programming and discovered love.
GUARD: Overcome their programming...
AGENT: Yeah. And to celebrate, you should skip work right now and go on a date.
Meanwhile ROBOT: Pretty please?
GUARD: Hmm... dying a horrible death in COMPOUND and being instantly forgotten, or going on a date at PLACE with the only person who cares...
ROBOT: CODENAME's right. C'mon. I'll show you all my favorite spots to find DISTRACTIONS.
GUARD: Oh, well, if you insist... let's go. (Exit stage right.)
Meanwhile ROBOT: (Exit stage right.)
(noir music 1)
AGENT: Well, RANK, you did it. Somehow.
CONTROL: Looks like the coast's clear, CODENAME. You can proceed down the hall.
AGENT: Is that going to happen every time I ask you for a distraction?
CONTROL: Could be. Why?
AGENT: I mean, it worked, it just doesn't seem very thematic for a stealth game. Usually the protagonist would be the one who's stealing hearts, right?
CONTROL: You? Fall in love? Pffft, get real. If you fell in love then ORGANIZATION would just take them as a hostage. That's a tragedy just waiting to happen.
AGENT: Well, then maybe I'll just have to charm an enemy spy or something. Add a dramatic moment where I have to choose between my heart and my mission, y'know?
CONTROL: Inadvisable, CODENAME. Please proceed down the hall so that you can overhear the leaders of ORGANIZATION when they loudly explain their plans.
TYPEWRITER: CODENAME was later captured by ORGANIZATION,;having tripped an alarm by mashing the INPUT;and accidentally breaking a window.

VIL: So, the HEROES decided to march again towards us.
VIL: Apparently, they wanted me to face my death as some false prophecy.
GUARD: Master, the HEROES are trying to stop you. The prophecy could be fulfilled someday! We've got to do something!
VIL: I am afraid this might be difficult, since many of those favorite supervillain friends of mine had fallen to grasps like these.
VIL: Remember what happened to BAD?
GUARD: What about BAD?
VIL: Did you hear? He was crushed to death by another group of heroes by falling ROCKS.
GUARD: From what I heard that death was accidental, and not by the heroes.
VIL: The stories lie about what truly happened to them! Even NEWS falls for the fake!
GUARD: Uh, you're right, they are wrong.
VIL: Exactly! They say prophecies are fulfilled when we try to avoid them, please, remind me again of the prophecy.
GUARD: Well, the PRIEST said that if you continue down this rabbit hole, then someone will stop you.
GUARD: But I forgot who, or how, certainly not falling ROCKS again like BAD.
VIL: Me neither, but we need to stop it before it gets fulfilled. Any ideas?
GUARD: (unsure) Uuuuuuuuhhhh.... Ummmmmmmmmm.......
VIL: (shakes the guard) Come on! Brainstorm! Focus!
Meanwhile GUARD: (shakes) Guh! Aaaaah!
VIL: If we sit here and do nothing all year long, the HEROES will attack and kill us all!
GUARD: Yes, they will!
VIL: But what can we do?
GUARD: Well, recently I have got word that the PLACE is looking for new volunteers.
VIL: Oh?

GUARD: Apparently, the HEROES have had a relationship with some SUB dude. Last location known was coincidentally PLACE.
GUARD: And nearby is the HEROES' new headquarters! We must spawn kill them in their own homes!
VIL: I am afraid we will not do that, my precious guard.
GUARD: Really? Why?
VIL: We can't just kill them, or else the prophecy will choose that SUB guy or another SUB guy to defeat us.

GUARD: Then if that is the case, shall we also exterminate the vermin that is the SUB?
VIL: (angry stare) No! That is waaaaay to far!
GUARD: But it is the only thing I know we can do.
VIL: (angrily yelling) Then why can't you think of anything else!?
GUARD: I am sorry! I am an unworthy person! We should stick to something simple!
Music Stops
VIL: Hmmm... We must keep an eye on them.
GUARD: Yes, we shall, master.
VIL: Send one of the quadrants of our army over to the PLACE to spy on the SUB guy and the HEROES.

MODERATOR: Hello, everybody, and welcome to the 20XX U.S. presidential debate! I am your moderator, Maud R.A. Torr.
MODERATOR: I can't wait to see this election wrapped up, how about you two?
PRESIDENT: Please!
Meanwhile RICHIE: Yes!
MODERATOR: Ooh, another agreement between our two candidates! Long-time election watchers will recall that our two candidates have agreed on literally every position!

MODERATOR: Candidates, please introduce yourself for the middle-class parents who were not paying attention to the race.
PRESIDENT: I am PRESNAME, your current president.
RICHIE: I am RICHNAME, and after these long years I have decided I want to never be your president.
MODERATOR: Ooh! I can't wait to see how that affects polling! Now let's get to our first topic of debate.
MODERATOR: PRESNAME, how do you intend to revitalize the dying jobs market that you created?
PRESIDENT: Great question, Maud. I'm not lifting a finger for you peasants.
MODERATOR: Uh-huh. And RICHNAME? Does your company has any use for the jobless masses?
RICHIE: I also don't intend to give any of you jobs. I am selling all my stocks and all my assets so that I can take a trip to VACATION.
MODERATOR: Ooooh, RICHNAME likes to live a little! As expected of the nation's richest worm. Okay, onto the next topic: education.
PRESIDENT: 2 + 2 = 5. Write that down, kiddos.

MODERATOR: PRESNAME, please wait your turn to speak.
PRESIDENT: No. I am the president! You can't tell me what to do! And what I want to do is lose!

MODERATOR: PRESNAME, please don't interrupt again.
PRESIDENT: I hate you all!

MODERATOR: Okay, your microphone has been shut off.
RICHIE: I will pay to turn PRESNAME's microphone back on. Name any price. No price is too much for me.
MODERATOR: Alright, now we proceed to... oh? I'm getting a call from backstage, they're saying they turned PRESNAME's mic back on.
RICHIE: Everybody, please look at this naked corruption of the political process and don't vote for me.
MODERATOR: Thank you, RICHNAME. Anyway, uh, what was our last topic again?
RICHIE: Ed-you-ma-kay-shun. Look, I can't even pronounce "education" right! Don't vote for me!
MODERATOR: Oh, thank you again, RICHNAME! Can't believe I forgot. Must be something in the water.
PRESIDENT: You're all being poisoned under my orders.
RICHIE: Not me, I have a private reserve I stole from VACATION.
MODERATOR: Wow! RICHNAME is prepared for anything and everything! Okay! Onto our next topic, CONCERN1! PRESNAME?
PRESIDENT: I will do whatever it takes to make you regret voting for me.
MODERATOR: Truly persuasive. What's your counter, RICHNAME?
RICHIE: You people actually care about CONCERN1? Whatever. What PRESNAME said, but I'm richer and scummier.
MODERATOR: Wow! Honesty is a virtue, as they say.
PRESIDENT: (Quietly) Duhhhhh...
MODERATOR: PRESNAME? Are you alright?

RICHIE: They're pretending to have a stroke on live TV! This is the kind of leadership our country needs! Everybody, please vote for PRESNAME!
PRESIDENT: Don't vote for me. Vote for RICHNAME.
RICHIE: Don't vote for me!
PRESIDENT: I'm not taking the blame for anything that happens over the next four years, you do it.
RICHIE: Everyone, if you vote for me, I am going to spend my entire term at VACATION! I won't show up for inauguration!
MODERATOR: I'd be fine with that, actually. You've got my vote.
RICHIE: No!
Meanwhile PRESIDENT: Yes!
MODERATOR: PRESNAME, how do you intend to improve upon your last term?
PRESIDENT: I won't improve. I will get worse. You are going to learn how bad I can be. Vote for RICHNAME.
RICHIE: Stop telling them to do that! Vote for PRESNAME! The country deserves somebody with experience!
MODERATOR: Okay, next topic. How do you two intend to lower the price of TRINKETs?
PRESIDENT: I will personally instruct manufacturers to lower their standards and start selling faulty product with my name and face on it.
RICHIE: I will buy up all the stock so that there's none left for any of you. Don't vote for me.
PRESIDENT: Vote for RICHNAME. Their solution means your kids won't get poisoned.
corporate motivational music
MODERATOR: Alright, enough excitement. Here's a viewer-submitted question by Roslyn Biggs from Mississississississississississississsississippi.
MODERATOR: Roslyn asks, "What will happen to CONCERN2?"
PRESIDENT: Completely eradicated. Blown to smithereens. I will immobilize DEPARTMENT to make your life miserable.
MODERATOR: Wow! I've never heard of that department before! You've got my vote. It means a lot to me that you'd share state secrets with us.
PRESIDENT: Don't vote for me or we're going to kidnap you.
RICHIE: Now, Maud, I don't think citizens have any reason to worry about CONCERN2.
RICHIE: In the not-so-far future, you will eat and sleep at my factories. You won't have rights.
MODERATOR: Excuse me, RICHNAME, our fact checkers just now said that earlier you said you wouldn't be giving anybody jobs. Can you explain this?
RICHIE: None of you are getting paid. It's not a job.
MODERATOR: Okay, onto our next question: Drew Kirkland from Newest York says "QUOTE".
PRESIDENT: "QUOTE"? Irrelevant. Allow me to say this, though...
PRESIDENT: Do not vote for me!
Meanwhile RICHIE: Do not vote for me!
PRESIDENT: The courts don't know this yet, but I am guilty of fifty counts of CRIME! I'll share the evidence on my blog today!
RICHIE: I was going to attempt ATTEMPT today but I couldn't fit it into my schedule! If you vote for me I will make that my top priority!
PRESIDENT: Do not vote for me!
Meanwhile RICHIE: Do not vote for me!
RICHIE: Make me lose!
Meanwhile PRESIDENT: Let me lose!
TYPEWRITER: PRESNAME would later win the presidency after;RICHNAME bought them exactly 270 electoral votes,;and no more.

australian music 1
NAR: Here, we observe two wild ANIMALs frolicking in the dense forest of LOCATION.
NAR: The ANIMAL, known scientifically as LATIN, is displaying classic mating behavior, trying to grab the female’s attention.
MALE: (overexcited and dancing) Becky! Hey Becky! Becky!
NAR: He attempts to impress her with food, and a dazzling showcase of his dancing mastery.
MALE: (overexcited) Becky! Becky, look at all of this FOOD, Becky! Omg this is so much FOOD to eat, this is like the best day ever.
MALE: Do you like the FOOD I got us, Becky? Do you?? Do you do you??
FEM: (impressed) Omg this is amazing I’ve been craving for FOOD since Tuesday, this is the best day ever indeed! Thank you thank you thank you!!!
NAR: The ANIMALs communicate through a series of SOUNDs, as well as dancing.
MALE: (dancing) SOUND Did you update your SM yet? We should totally post about finding this FOOD.
FEM: (dancing) Already did! Added like, seven EMOJI emojis and everything.
NAR: Fascinating! The younger, female ANIMAL appears to be establishing dominance using modern technology!
NAR: But wait- what's this?? A larger male rival ANIMAL approaches!
BIG: (swaggering in confidently) Step aside, undercooked romance--Becky deserves Gourmet, not some fast-food trash. Behold! (starts dancing)
MALE: Oh, oh we're doing this now?? (starts dancing harder) I've learned everything there is to know about dancing from tutorials on SM.
BIG: (flipping hair while dancing) My skin care routine has three steps and a mission plan.
MALE: (keep dancing) He moisturizes?? Becky, I moisturize! Sometimes!
BIG: (keep dancing) Didn't think you'd settle for *that* guy, Becky. I brought triple-cooked FOOD, and it's INGREDIENT free.
NAR: A rare spectacle! Two males competing for dominance through excessive FOOD bragging and interpretive dancing.
MALE: (dancing) INGREDIENT-free?? Becky's not even INGREDIENT-intolerant!
FEM: I could be INGREDIENT-intolerant! For him...
MALE: Uh, Becky and I already have plans dude. You need to back off.
BIG: Plans? More like plant-based disappointment. Watch THIS! (does a very extra dance move)
FEM: (Very flattered) Oh-oh wow! Okay, okay, this is... kind of amazing...
NAR: The female appears to be visibly impressed. Whether by the FOOD or by the footwork, science may never know.
BIG: (continues to do very extra dance) I took a contemporary movement class for this exact scenario.
FEM: Oh my god, wait, hold on. (starts recording with phone) Do that again but like... slower. I'm totally posting this on my SM.
BIG: Make sure to get my good side--No, better side-- No, spin and pose (dramatic spin before dramatic pose) Tag me @BigMoves69 underscore underscore.
NAR: A bold move, advertising his tag mid-courtship. Truly, a creature of the digital age.
BIG: (flip hair and dance even more dramatically) They said I was too passionate, too interpretive.... but I say, too ADJECTIVE.
MALE: Becky! I'm emotionally available and physically mobile, look! (dancing harder) Remember the FOOD I got you! And the sparkle filter I used on our SM selfies!
NAR: The smaller male intensifies his display, desperate and glistening with effort.
NAR: He's combining movement and memory in a last-ditch effort to secure the female's attention.
BIG: Becky! I already made us a shared playlist and synced our SM stories. Our auras are like, totally aligned.
FEM: Oh my God I'm like so totally into you.
MALE: But the sparkle filter, Becky! The sparkle filter!
NAR: But wait! A predatory PREDATOR approaches them unexpectedly from the back!
lacrimosa music
PRED: (enter stage sneaking up from behind) Hmmmm yes protein walking protein very convenient very tasty hmmm yes
NAR: As the dance battle escalate, danger approaches, and the ANIMALs don’t realize there’s a hidden PREDATOR sneaking up on them.
FEM: Wait wait hold on, before I post, (shows phone to other ANIMALs) does this photo make my butt look big?
NAR: And in a shocking twist that happens every day in nature, the dangerous PREDATOR attacks the smaller male ANIMAL!
music stops
anime sword gleam 1
PRED: (attacks smaller male ANIMAL) Dinner time!
MALE: (gets attacked) SOUND!!!
Meanwhile FEM: SOUND!!!
MALE: Run Becky! Run for your life! Ruuuuuuunnnnnn!
Meanwhile FEM: (start running around in circles, panicking and SOUNDing)
epic cinematic music
PRED: (brutally attacking ANIMAL) MMMM YOU TASTE DELICIOUS
MALE: SOUND Run for your life, Becky, Run!
BIG: Should I like, help? Or is this one of those "let him grow from this experience" kind of things?
FEM: (run away off stage)
NAR: Remarkable! The PREDATOR has captured one of our ANIMAL friends! Nature can be so cruel yet so ADJECTIVE.
MALE: NO WAIT COME BACK! BECKY! I can’t believe you actually left me I was just trying to look heroic I didn’t mean it! BECKY! BECKYYYY!!!
BIG: This is clearly the universe telling me to vibe somewhere else. (backs away)
PRED: OM NOM NOM NOM NOM (eating the ANIMAL)
BIG: I support you emotionally, but not physically! (runs) Don't forget to tag me if you live!
BIG: (leaving) Becky! BECKY! Don't worry Becky, I've got a backup FOOD stash and a playlist called "Survival", each song was hand selected by CELEB. (exit)
MALE: NOOO I’m being eaten, this is the end! Goodbye, Becky! I must update this on my SM, quickly!
MALE: (Take a selfie on smartphone) (Typing a SM post) "So long, my followers, #FinalPost #BeckyLeftMe #NaturesAVillain," send.….. blarg- (dies).
PRED: Finally! Dinner time! My many children will feel so EMOTION!
sad chug jug music
NAR: And thus continues the circle of life, a cycle so cruel and yet so ADJECTIVE.
Happy music 1
NAR: Tune in next week when we observe the mating habits of the elusive CELEB and showcase just how ADJECTIVE they too can be.

CUST: (Shocked and small gasp) How did you know I was here for a FISH? And that my name is NAME??
OWNR: Listen, NAME, you need to get your memory problems sorted out. This is the 19th Sunday in a row that you've came into this STORE to ask for a FISH.

OWNR: Yeah, you should! Do you?
CUST: I think I'd notice a BUILDING full of FISH.
OWNR: I don't know what you're doing with all of them, and at this point I should stop selling you these FISH, but I'm also desperate for PAYMENT.
CUST: Now that I think about it I do have vague memories of getting a FISH, but if I really did have one, my PET CATN would watch guard!
CUST: He's so ADJECTIVE by it, always watching guard. What a good PET!
OWNR: ADJECTIVE by it like I'm ADJECTIVE by a FOOD.
OWNR: But I'm warning you, when I'm financially stable enough, I'm going to stop funding this ridiculous routine. These FISH are pets, not PET treats.
CUST: Well don't worry, I plan on making this FISH a pet, CATN will make sure to watch over it well. One FISH, please!
OWNR: (mutters) Your PET probably marks it as `FISH delivery day` on its calendar.
OWNR: (Checking out) Welp, that'll cost ya PAYMENT, I want 40 for it.

mystery music 1
police car
COP1: (Loudly through a megaphone) This is the police! Come out with your hands up and ACTION peacefully! We have this place partially surrounded.
CRIM: (Pacing back and forth before screaming out the window) NEVER! I refuse to ACTION!
COP1: (Through megaphone) You have no way out of this one. If you ACTION now, we can talk about cutting a deal.
CRIM: (out the window) Don't play with me, I have hostages! (go to open the door and grab the hostage)
meanwhile HOST: (get grabbed by criminal, hands restrained behind back)
HOST: (getting dragged out towards window) Ouch! Hey, watch the suit! This is dry clean only!
meanwhile CRIM: (Holds hostage up to window)
CRIM: (holding hostage up to window) You see this?? This poor innocent PERSON is in MY hands, and I have demands.
HOST: (held up to window nonchalantly) Hey what's up?
COP1: (through walkie) He has an innocent PERSON! I'll need some backup. (through megaphone) Alright, let's talk. What do you want?
CRIM: First, I want 1DEMAND and I want it NOW!
COP1: (through megaphone) Uhm, can you demand something a bit more.... reasonable? 1DEMAND is pretty... unrealistic here.
CRIM: (out window) So now you're telling me what I can and can't demand?? Who has the PERSON as their hostage here???
HOST: No, he's right, your demand is totally unreasonable and TERRIBLE. You need something better, like 2DEMAND!
CRIM: (at hostage) Whose side are you on?
HOST: I'm just saying, if you're gonna make demands, make GOOD ones. Asking for 1DEMAND is just, just TERRIBLE. You got one shot at this, you got this!
CRIM: (nodding) Yeah, yeah okay. (out the window) Alright. I've decided, I instead want 2DEMAND.
COP1: (to self) That's even more ridiculous! Where is he getting these demands from??
COP1: (through megaphone) Look, I'm trying to work with you here, but 2DEMAND? That's even worse!
COP1: (through megaphone) Why not something like a pizza, or a getaway car, or 5DEMAND? C'mon, work with me here!
CRIM: (angrily at the hostage, shaking) You said that was a good demand!
meanwhile HOST: (getting shaken)
HOST: Hey hey, I'm just trying to help! Listen, the faster you get your demands, the faster I get out of here. It's a win for both of us!
HOST: (thinking) How about 3DEMAND?
CRIM: 3DEMAND? Yeah... that might work. (goes to window) HEY! I want 3DEMAND!
COP1: (to self) Finally, something a little more reasonable.
COP1:(through megaphone) Look, we MIGHT be able to get you 3DEMAND, but we need you to calm down and work with us, alright?
Meanwhile COP2: (head up to narrator podium next to Cop1)
COP2: How's the hostage situation going?
COP1: Not very good. They've already asked for 1DEMAND, 2DEMAND, and 3DEMAND! Next thing you know they'll ask for 4DEMAND!
HOST: (to criminal) You know, I think you should also ask for 4DEMAND. That way, it gives you something to negotiate about.
CRIM: We're ALREADY negotiating!
HOST: I'm just saying, all of the other criminals that asked for 4DEMAND got their own Netflix documentaries.
CRIM: (nodding in agreement) Yeah, yeah you're right. (out window) HEY! I'm not done making demands! I've decided I also want 4DEMAND!
COP1: (to other cop) Can he hear us?? (through megaphone) Did you hear us?
CRIM: (out window) WHAT? Can you repeat that? Speak up! I can't hear you, I'm talking through a window.
COP2: (looks at cop1) I don't think he can hear us.
COP1: Alright, this just getting ridiculous. (to the other cop) We need you to go under cover. Act as a FOOD delivery person and go deliver them FOOD.
COP2: But they didn't even order FOOD-
COP1: It's a free FOOD, no one turns down free FOOD! And take him down when you're inside.
COP2: Yes, sir! (salutes before walking off towards stage entrance, don't enter yet)
CRIM: (To hostage) I think this is going pretty well so far. They're listening to my demands.
HOST: See? Just gotta ask the right stuff!
heavy door knocking
music stops
COP2: (behind door) Uhhh FOOD Delivery!
groose music
CRIM: FOOD delivery?? Oh boy I'm starved! Hey wait-- I don't remember ordering any FOOD. (looks at hostage) Did you order any??
HOST: No, but can we eat it? I'm really hungry and some FOOD sounds really delicious right now.
CRIM: Hold on.... I think this could be a trap.
HOST: Or it could be a heaping pile of FOOD! Delicious, warm, free FOOD!
CRIM: (Nodding) Alright, alright. Bring it in, but no funny business.
COP2: (enters dressed as FOOD delivery person) One extra peace offering with a side of negotiation!
CRIM: What kind of FOOD is this??
COP2: Uhhh... the ADJ kind?
CRIM: I knew it!
scary music
CRIM: (Grab the cop and tie him up, throwing him with the other hostage) It was a trick, but your plan failed. You're MY hostage now.
meanwhile COP2: (gets tied up and thrown with the other hostage)
COP1: (through megaphone) What, you took the FOOD guy hostage now too??
COP2: SENTENCE!
HOST: Welcome to the club! First time being a hostage?
COP2: No, but definitely the 1ADJest.
noir music 1
COP1: (through Megaphone) Alright this is just getting embarrassing, you have TWO hostages now. What's your endgame here?
CRIM: (thinking) Hmmmm, I think I want 5DEMAND.
HOST: Bigger, BIGGER!
COP2: (groaning) Stop helping him!
CRIM: Yeah, yeah! (out window) I want 5DEMAND, and also uhh... (thinking)
COP1: (to self) Finally! Something I can do! (through megaphone) Look I'm starting to get really tired of all of your nonsense, but I promise I can get you 5DEMAND.
CRIM: (suspicious) What's the catch?
COP1: (through megaphone) Look, we know you're inside, and we've got at least two cops in the area. You've made your demands, and we're ready to make a deal.
CRIM: I'm not making a deal, I'm making a DEMAND, and I want it now!
HOST: 5DEMAND? You're really sticking with that?
CRIM: Yes! And YOU (pointing at the hostage) are going to help me get it.
HOST: (Shrugs) Well, I tried.
CRIM: (to hostages) I need them to take me seriously! (out window) If I don't get my 5DEMAND in 5 MINUTES, something bad will happen.
COP1: (through megaphone) Oh yeah? Like what?
CRIM: I'll uh... I'll start 1ACTing!
HOST: (horrified) No! Anything but 1ACTing!
COP2: You've experienced it before?
HOST: No, I'm just trying to be supportive.
COP1: (to self) I don't even know what that means but I'll do anything to stop it.
COP1: (through megaphone) Listen, we're bringing 5DEMAND over right now! Just PLEASE don't start 1ACTing!
CRIM: Finally! They're actually taking me seriously, I'll get 5DEMAND in no time!
tire screech
COP1: (through megaphone) Alright, I have your 5DEMAND here, but I need you to come outside for it.
CRIM: No, I want you to bring it in here.
COP1: Uhm, that's just simply not possible. Look, 5DEMAND is right here, but you're gonna have to come outside to get it.
CRIM: No, I make the demands here, and I demand you deliver 5DEMAND straight to this office doorstep. I don't care if it's "not possible", find a way!
COP1: (Sighs) He's really not making this easy.
COP2: (whispers to hostage) My leg is falling asleep.
meanwhile COP1: (running around to entrance)
HOST: (whispers to hostage cop) I've been holding my pee for over 2 hours now.
meanwhile COP1: (running around to entrance, pull out gun)
heavy door knocking
COP1: (holding gun in front of door) Alright, I'm here with your 5DEMAND. Open the door and we can finish this.
CRIM: Finally! I'm going to get my 5DEMAND! (opens door for cop) Where is my 5DEMAND??

THIEF: I’m saving them! 1NAME hasn’t ACTIONed this poor thing since the CELEBRATION.

THIEF: Just enough to keep them EMOTION.
COW: EMOTION?
THIEF: Yeah, you think plants don't feel? This one has been wilting with silent disappointment since April!
COW: (Scoffs) Plants don't have emotions, they can't feel EMOTION.
THIEF: That's what we're led to believe, society is easily influenced by Government propaganda. But I've seen it. I've seen it with my own two eyes.
THIEF: The drooping. The passive-aggressive leaning towards the sunlight. The SIGN. The fern in the copy room even developed anxiety!
COW: C-come on, Anxiety? Do you... actually believe that?

THIEF: It's not the worst I've seen. I've had a Ficus that grew backwards for two weeks straight. Existential crisis.
COW: What do you mean it grew backwards? How does a plant even do that?
THIEF: Like it was trying to *un*-grow and erase itself. And don't even get me started on that 3PLANT that refused to photosynthesis out of pure spite.
COW: I thought this one was just... ADJ.
THIEF: No such thing as a ADJ plant. Just misunderstood.

HAR: And yet distinctly lacking in RODENTs.
CAS: Are you ever going to stop with the RODENTs?
HAR: NEVER! Poetry is about *evolution*, Cas. Growth. (teasing) And clearly RODENTs are the pinnacle of artistic progress.
CAS: (Shakes head endearingly with a sigh, sitting down) Oh, Harper.
JOR: Alright Harper, since you're so committed to our RODENT overlords, let's hear what *you* have to say!
HAR: (stands up dramatically clearing throat) Oh, you *wish* you were ready for this! I get my inspiration from, let's say personal experience.
HAR: *Moonlight on still ponds // whispers weave through silent pines // RODENT takes the stage*
JOR: A true masterpiece.
CAS: (grinning) I can't say I didn't love that.
HAR: Admit it, Casey! The RODENT agent is growing on ya!
CAS: Against my will!
HAR: That's how true art works! (sits down) It seeps into your SOUL when you least expect it.
JOR: Next thing you know, you'll be writing your own RODENT haiku!

HAR: Oh, but imagine it! A heartful Haiku-
JOR: (chimes in) for a small noble RODENT-
HAR: Searching for a meaning-

HAR: (whispers) ...on a hunt for 2FOOD!
HAR: Jordan gets it! (High five Jordan)

CAS: The power of confusion.
JOR: The power of art, Casey. Poetry isn't about making sense - it's about how it makes you *feel*.
HAR: Where was the inspiration behind that poem anyways?
JOR: Oh! I got it from 2INS.

VENDOR: Excellent choice, CUSNAME! Might I recommend FINGERFOOD1?

DIRECTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Harper. I’m so sorry for your loss. I understand you're here to finalize arrangements for your father's passing.
MRSHARPER: Yes, thank you. We want something dignified, respectful, you know, traditional.
MRHARPER: Right. Nothing too flashy.
DIRECTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. Everything we do here at Eternal Horizons and SMOBJECTs is truly dignified.
DIRECTOR: We do offer a lovely casket made out of TEXTURE if you’d prefer something classic.
MRSHARPER: No, actually.
MRHARPER: Honey, your dad always liked things simple. Maybe just a STNOUN?
MRSHARPER: Harold, please. This is not the place to crack jokes.
DIRECTOR: STNOUN? Great choice. Now, have you considered a celebration of life service?
MRSHARPER: Oh, I love that idea! Something where everyone can share memories in a fun and relaxed setting.
DIRECTOR: Perfect! We can end the ceremony by launching him out of a LHNOUN to the soothing sounds of "My Heart Will Go On" by Celine Dion.
MRSHARPER: Wait. What?
MRHARPER: It's what he would have wanted.
DIRECTOR: It’s becoming very popular! We have a licensed OCCUPATION on staff who handles the trajectory.
MRHARPER: That's very impressive.
MRSHARPER: No, it's not impressive. And quite frankly, it's offensive we're even having this conversation.
MRHARPER: Okay, so when we launch him, where exactly does he land?
MRSHARPER: (angry) Harold!
DIRECTOR: Great question. We aim for a PLACE. Very precise.
MRSHARPER: That's insane! My father was a OCC2, not a circus act!
MRHARPER: Fair point. Counterpoint. He wasn't very good at that.
DIRECTOR: We'll even let the family choose the SMOBJECT he's holding as he soars.
MRHARPER: Honey, he did always say he wanted to "go out with a bang."
MRSHARPER: We went over this, Harold. He meant that he wanted to sleep with someone other than his wife before he passed.
DIRECTOR: And for the final touch, a recording of CELEBRITY delivering his eulogy as he takes flight.
MRSHARPER: That's neat, actually. But I don't like how that is the most normal thing we've talked about so far.
MRSHARPER: I just want a simple funeral. No explosions, no RNOUNs.
DIRECTOR: I understand. Simple. But the cannon package comes with a complimentary FOODITEM for all the guests.
MRHARPER: I mean free food.
MRSHARPER: I am this close to putting you in that LHNOUN and blasting your dumbass into the sun.

ALEX: Alright team, we’ve received feedback from the beta testers. And by feedback, I mean 3,482 posts about one thing.
CASEY: The combat? The story?
ALEX: No. The BODYPART.
TAYLOR: Sweet! The single white male demographic really coming in through the clutch there.
JORDAN: Ah yes. The fans are saying we need to dial up the realism.
TAYLOR: One guy wrote, "I want them to move like SMOBJECT in zero gravity."
ALEX: That's quite realistic.
CASEY: Okay, okay. So what are we thinking? More bounce? Less bounce?
ALEX: We need to nail the sweet spot. I'm talking maximum ADJECT without breaking the engine.
JORDAN: If we go too far, the physics engine crashes. Remember the time Mai's BODYPART jiggled for NUMBER minutes in a cutscene?
CASEY: That went on for so long.
TAYLOR: No, it was the right amount of time.
CASEY: Okay, so let’s break this down. I propose three prototypes. The BODYPART can VERB with grace, attitude, or like it's possessed.
ALEX: Hmm. I like it. But we need data. Scientific data. This would be data that we'd be collecting several times a day.
JORDAN: I could create a simulation where we test the physics using NUMBER different force variables.
CASEY: Ohhh! And we’ll model it in Blender using CELEBRITY as a reference.
TAYLOR: Horrifying. Brilliant. But we’ll need focus groups. I say we get input from PLACE regulars.
TAYLOR: They know bounce when they see it.
ALEX: Great. I’ll pitch it to the execs. But we have to be careful.
JORDAN: Why?
ALEX: Because last time we "enhanced" the physics, someone’s BODYPART glitched through the map and became a deadly weapon.
CASEY: Ah, the infamous “BODYPART a-saurus” incident.
JORDAN: I remember now! There were mass casualties in real life. Something about things lasting longer than NUMBER hours.
ALEX: Alright, people. Let’s get to work. If these jiggles aren’t ADJECT, we’re toast.
ALEX: Now, who wants to test the prototype on SMOBJECT physics?
JORDAN: Guys, I have something.
CASEY: Oh no.
JORDAN: Behold! I introduce… the LGOBJECT!
TAYLOR: Wait. Is that LGOBJECT filled with SMOBJECTs?
JORDAN: Yup. I figured if we’re gonna simulate bounce of a BODYPART, we need a real-life model.
CASEY: It looks oddly majestic, perhaps even date-able.
ALEX: Alright. For science. Let's test it.

CASEY: Hmmm. Nice ADJECT texture.
TAYLOR: Oh wow, it VERBs just like in-game.
JORDAN: WHOA! It’s got some ADJECT energy!

(noir music 4)
CHIEF: (Walk on stage and approach desk) Well Detective Guy you really did it now! The interrogation was worthless!
CHIEF: How could you convince yourself that VIP was part of the GROUP!?
CHIEF: Even if they were, no jury would convict them. There would be riots in the streets if they did!
NORMAN: I'm sorry chief. We didn't know who the driver would be.
CHIEF: You need to take responsibility for this, Norman! I'm demoting you to TASK!
NORMAN: TASK!? Come on chief! I was just following a tip!
CHIEF: We're still recovering from the ITEM incident. I can't let your actions go unpunished!
NORMAN: The ITEM incident wasn't even my fault! Why am I being punished for it?!
CHIEF: It's just the timing. We need to punish bad police actions to maintain our credibility.
CHIEF: Sorry to say this, but you're no longer Detective Norman Guy. You're now TASK officer Norman Guy.
CHIEF: Maybe you can work your way back up to vice. But you have to be out of this office by the end of the week.
NORMAN: I can't accept this, Chief! What if VIP is in on it? We can't just let them go!
CHIEF: You still think that? Even after you searched the vehicle and found only COVERs?
NORMAN: Maybe they were on their way to get the DRUG!
CHIEF: Would you say that to their face? (Look at door) Come on in, VIP!
SUSPECT: (Walk on stage and approach desk) Hello Detective Guy, or should I say TASK officer Guy!
SUSPECT: Serves you right for what you did to me!
PARTNER: (Walk on stage and look around) Pretty nice office you had here. Heh heh.
NORMAN: What are they doing here, Chief?
CHIEF: I wanted them to tell you what they told me. So you can hear just how wrong you were.
SUSPECT: If you must know what I was doing, my partner and I were on our way to a EVENT when you arrested us!
PARTNER: Without even asking any questions I might add!
NORMAN: Well I am sorry! I was doing my job!
SUSPECT: I will have you know I was arrested only once for CRIME. I did my time and that's was it!
SUSPECT: I've never even seen DRUG in real life, let alone tried to smuggle it across town!
SUSPECT: How dare you assume I am a member of that dreadful GROUP group!
PARTNER: We're probably going to miss the EVENT now because of this.
PARTNER: (Look at Chief) You better be serious about this demotion. Is he really going to stay in TASK for a while?
CHIEF: Of course, you have my word. He was a fool to suspect you and VIP of wrongdoing.
PARTNER: I hope so. You wouldn't want another ITEM incident so soon, would you?
CHIEF: N-NO Of course not!
NORMAN: Why are you so concerned with what happens to me? I didn't even suspect you.
PARTNER: (Point at the detective) You suspected VIP! Who I love dearly! I want to make sure justice is served!
SUSPECT: If we find out you're a detective again after 2 weeks we'll tell NEWS all about this!
CHIEF: You should know about NEWS, Norman. They exposed us for the ITEM incident.
CHIEF: VIP has agreed not to go public with this as long as I demote you.
NORMAN: Hmm... Why though? Why is it so important to you that I get demoted for this. Do you have something to hide?
PARTNER: We don't want to give your station another scandal. We're trying to be nice.
SUSPECT: But if you don't pay the price then we will go public with this. I have connections!
NORMAN: What's stopping you from taking this story to NEWS anyway?
NORMAN: How do we know you won't have your cake and eat it too?
PARTNER: It would be messy if we went to NEWS and told them you arrested us on suspicion of DRUG smuggling.
SUSPECT: (Nods) In case you haven't noticed I am VIP! I have a reputation to uphold!
NORMAN: What reputation? No one outside of town knows who you are!
SUSPECT: (Gasp) How DARE You! You talk to me like that again and I'll have your badge!
PARTNER: All we want you to do is apologize for arresting us and accept your demotion.
NORMAN: (Sigh) I apologize for arresting you and I accept the demotion. There!
CHIEF: Well I guess that makes it official then.
SUSPECT: Good! Hmm, Officer Guy. It has a nice ring to it. (Turn to Chief) Would you escort me out of the station?
CHIEF: Oh of course, right this way, VIP. (Gesture towards door and walk off stage)
SUSPECT: So polite. (Follow the Chief off stage)
NORMAN: (Point at the suspect's partner) I want you to stay.
PARTNER: Why?
NORMAN: Your voice sounds oddly familiar to me, where do I know you from?
PARTNER: (In a sinister tone) Heh, Why don't you take a guess?
NORMAN: Hmmmm... We didn't meet at last year's EVENT... did we?
PARTNER: No. I've never been to one before. You made me late for this years EVENT.
NORMAN: Wait! It was you wasn't it? You were the one who called me with the tip!
(noir music 3)
PARTNER: Heh heh heh heh. So you did figure it out.
NORMAN: You set all this up! Didn't you!?
PARTNER: Indeed I did. It was perfect. Make VIP look suspicious and watch the fireworks.
PARTNER: Now you won't be bothering the GROUP for a long while.
NORMAN: I should have known from the start! You're a Member of the GROUP aren't you!?
PARTNER: Just an associate. Meaning my hands are clean.
PARTNER: You were too hot on the trail. So the GROUP had me plan this little scheme to take you out.
PARTNER: DRUG being smuggled in COVERs, it was genius.
PARTNER: Believable enough to be true but absurd enough to make you look like a fool.
PARTNER: And with the ITEM incident still on everyone's mind, it was easy to convince the chief to take action.
PARTNER: Now you'll spend your days slaving away on meaningless TASK crimes.
PARTNER: Got any final words to say before I take my leave... Officer?
NORMAN: Well Just a few (Point at them) Freeze! You're under arrest for conspiracy and obstruction of justice!
PARTNER: W-What NO! I Didn't do anything! You can't arrest me!
NORMAN: Of Course I can! I'm still a cop! And you just confessed your entire plan to me! Put your hands behind your back!
PARTNER: N-NO! NO! I Can't go to jail! (run off stage)
NORMAN: Get back here! (run off stage)

DETECTIVE: Well, well, well, what do we have here? It looks like we have ourselves a ADJECTIVE criminal. What do you have to say for yourself?
CRIMINAL: Detective, I really don't understand why you have brought me in. I am innocent.
DETECTIVE: That is exactly what a criminal would say! It is too late now. You might as well admit to it.
CRIMINAL: Admit to what? I told you I haven't been doing anything Illegal.
DETECTIVE: So you are saying you were not at the PLACE where you were seen CRIME.
CRIMINAL: What? No. Wait, is CRIME really against the law?
DETECTIVE: Of course it is, as of TIME ago! What a silly question. We have had reports of someone CRIME at the PLACE.
DETECTIVE: So then, remind me again what it is you do for a living?
CRIMINAL: I don't see how that is relevant but I am a JOB.
DETECTIVE: A JOB, that sounds suspicious.
CRIMINAL: I think I need to call my Lawyer.
DETECTIVE: (Surprised) What?! No. You don't need some sleazeball of a lawyer. Look, admit to CRIME in the PLACE, and we will reduce your sentence to TIME in the slammer.
CRIMINAL: I am sorry, Detective ... (Calls out to someone out of scene) HEY LAWYER!

LAWYER: You called?
(courtroom music)
DETECTIVE: Wait, it can't be ... LAWYER?
LAWYER: That's my name! Now, Let's get down to business. Detective, What is my client being accused of?
DETECTIVE: They have been taken into custody for the crime of CRIME at the PLACE.
LAWYER: (With surprise) At the PLACE? Wait, Hold on. I need to talk with my client in private.
DETECTIVE: (Suspiciously) Fine, You have TIME to talk with your client. (Exit stage right)
(corporate guitar music)
LAWYER: (Make sure the door is closed) Were you actually CRIME at the PLACE?
CRIMINAL: What? CRIME isn't even against the law! Detective must be making it up.
LAWYER: Actually, it has been since TIME ago. That doesn't really matter anymore. Look, I have a way to get you out of this, but you are going to have to play along!
CRIMINAL: I don't want to do TIME in the slammer. I would lose my job.
LAWYER: Well, if you don't play along say goodbye to being a JOB, because your career is out of here!
CRIMINAL: Yeah, I don't think anybody would higher a JOB who has been in prison.
CRIMINAL: I am still surprised you can answer so fast when somebody calls your name. What is your secret?
LAWYER: That's classified! Only myself and the ADJECTIVE GROUP of lawyers can ever know.
LAWYER: (Call out to someone out of scene) Okay, detective. You can come back now!
DETECTIVE: (Enter stage right) Now, LAWYER, has your client come to their senses and is ready to admit to CRIME?
LAWYER: Of course not! My client is innocent, INNOCENT, I SAY!

DETECTIVE: ALIBI ... No, That is perfectly legal.
DETECTIVE: I suppose you can't CRIME while you are ALIBI.
LAWYER: Well, There you have it! There is no way that my client could possibly be CRIME when, at the time, they were actually ALIBI.
DETECTIVE: Fine, you are free to go. It looks like I still have a CRIME criminal to catch. (Exit stage right)
LAWYER: (Check to see that the door is closed) That was a close one. It is a good thing you still ALIBI.
CRIMINAL: Yeah, but it was a bit embarrassing to admit to it.

QUILL: What? Border? No, I don't know what's going on. Where am I? (stand up) and who are you?
BILLYWICK: Im Bellywick, and you’re in the King's camp 6 miles away from the border between the Tri-Race Alliance and the ever expanding Demon territory.
BILLYWICK: I found you lying under a pile of RUBBLE in a decimated village. I believe you were the only survivor. Do you remember anything before going unconscious?

QUILL: And why do you need my BODY PART to see my magical power?
BELLTOW: Because that's where mana is the easiest to measure from. All I have to do is poke this artifact into your skin, which may hurt a little.
QUILL: That artifact is literally a REAL WORLD ITEM. You are going to stick a REAL WORLD ITEM in my BODY PART
BILLYWICK: What's a REAL WORLD ITEM?

BELLTOW: You got it, Quill. 3, 2, 1 (Place REAL WORLD ITEM On Quill's BODY PART)
QUILL: (in pain) So what does it say
BELLTOW: Will, from the looks of it, you have body enhancement type mana, which could explain why you're not dead.
BELLTOW: It also says that you’re ADJECTIVE and have no NOUN.
BILLYWICK: What about his mana levels? What does it say there?

KING VIRGLE: Hahaha, Tiss a long name indeed, you, you are a funny one. You must be Quill, and yes, I'm the King, Ruler of SOMTHING
KING VIRGLE: I hear you have a mana level will over 9000. The readings say that you have body enhancement-type mana and that you’re ADJECTIVE with no NOUN.
QUILL: (annoyed) Yes, that is what Belltow said.
KING VIRGLE: Those are the highest mana levels we have ever seen, not including Demon King Velvo. Besides you, our highest mana-leveled fighter is Billywick
BILLYWICK: That being said, even then, I come miles short of your mana levels. I only have a mana level of 3600, and you Quill, you are double that.
BELLTOW: I myself only have a mana level of 2850
KING VIRGLE: Sir Quill, would you do use, no the world the favor of joining Billywick on a jearny to defeat the Demon King.
KING VIRGLE: But be warned, Velvo wields WEAPON, a most powerful weapon that can bring the end to anyone it faces.
tense cinematic music
QUILL: You know what, I will, on one condition.
KING VIRGLE: What is it
QUILL: Billywick said that there is a CASTLE’S BUILDING in you’r castle with knolage malti dimensional telapotaion magic. I want access to it.
KING VIRGLE: The CASTLE’S BUILDING does have many ancient books and spells on various topics. You may find what you're looking for, but it's not for certain.
KING VIRGLE: It is also dangerous, filled with CREATURES who will try to grab you from the BODY PART.
KING VIRGLE: If you are prepared for that, then you can go inside after killing Velvo.
QUILL: Then consider The Demon King vanquished.
silly music 2
QUILL: By the way, how do you use magic?
BELLTOW: I can train you in the ways of mana manipulation and the sword.
BILLYWICK: I'll train with you. We must know each other if we are to defeat the Demon King
KING VIRGLE: Go then train your body and mana. In 4 months, you leave for Velvo’s Castle and bring peace to our world once and for all
KING VIRGLE: Or die like the other thousands of heroes we sent.

QUILL: Unfortunately, he died being impaled by Velvo’s WEAPON.
KING VIRGLE: Very unfortunate, indeed. Let it be known that the day Velvo was defeated will be known as Billywicks Day in honor of a fallen hero,
KING VIRGLE: I will also have a statue built in your and Billywicks' name.
QUILL: Yeah, I do not care. Can I have access to your CASTLE’S BUILDING now? I wanna find a teleportation spell.
KING VIRGLE: Ah, yes, of course. Answer me this, though; why do you seek this type of magic?

JESSICA: So, has everyone ordered the vegan FOODITEM?
JESSICA: Literally can’t support any place that serves something with a visible BODYPART.
MARCO: Oh my goodness. That's really brave of you.
MARCO: I stopped eating anything that casts a RNOUN shadow.
MARCO: I'm not trying to ingest any oppressive light manipulation.
Aww
TAYLOR: That’s cute, it really is.
TAYLOR: I only eat food that’s been VERBed by a certified emotional support farmer. Preferably named FNAME.
SAM: I just lick the condensation off ethically-sourced SMOBJECT. Anything else is complicit in the moisture industrial complex.
Applause
JESSICA: Did you know this place donates 3% of profits to CAUSE.
JESSICA: I mean, that’s basically activism with a side of FOODITEM.
MARCO: Only 3%? Please. The co-op I shop at gives back NUMBER percent.
MARCO: And every receipt is printed on pressed MATERIAL.
TAYLOR: Namaste, brother. I literally made a blanket out of MATERIAL to keep feral ANIMALs warm in my backyard sanctuary.
JESSICA: It's behind my solar meditation pod.

SAM: Namaste! I spent the last three months in IKEA, teaching at-risk RNOUNs how to reclaim their BODYPART identities.
MARCO: And I bet you respect their shadows so much.
JESSICA: I led a silent protest against FOREIGNNAME's unethical latte art. The microfoam was ADJECT.
MARCO: My barista only makes pour-overs while whispering affirmations into each bean. That’s the only way I can taste the awareness.
TAYLOR: For breakfast, I chew on RNOUNs and journal about my carbon footprint with a pen made from SMOBJECT.
SAM: And you know what else? I've stopped using time NUMBER minutes ago.
TAYLOR: Honestly, guys. I've been thinking of canceling myself. I'm the problem.
MARCO: Power move. I appreciate how you're not guilt-shaming.
SAM: Respect. I already canceled myself after accidentally donating less than NUMBER percent to CAUSE last month.
Tada
JESSICA: You guys are inspirational. I’m going to untag myself from my own birth photos tonight.
TAYLOR: And maybe we can all Venmo each other reparations?
MARCO: So, after everyone is canceled at our table, do we want to record each other's apology videos?
TAYLOR: Ooooh, yes! But only if they’re filmed in front of a LOCATION with a single tear rolling down the BODYPART.
SAM: I'll apologize to my past self, then ghost them.
JESSICA: This is beautiful. I feel healed just talking about it.
MARCO: But sadly, everyone in this restaurant wants us to leave.

Steve: Adventure? What are you talking about Alex?
Alex: You know… the MISSION! The one we’ve been planning for weeks!
Steve: We’ve been planning… what now?
Alex: The PICKLE Run! It’s time to go get Aunt Mabel’s PICKLEs.
Alex: But this time, we’re not just picking up PICKLEs Steve. We’re on a MISSION. This is gonna be big.
Steve: Alex, I think you might be taking this a little too seriously. It’s just a CONTAINER of PICKLEs.
Alex: No, Steve. These aren’t just any PICKLEs. These are Aunt Mabel’s PICKLEs.
Alex: And do you know what’s more dangerous than a CONTAINER of Aunt Mabel’s PICKLEs?
Steve: I can’t even imagine.
Alex: A missing CONTAINER of Aunt Mabel’s PICKLEs, Steve. You don’t wanna know what happens when people run out of Aunt Mabel’s PICKLEs.
Alex: CHAOS. Panic. The whole town could go into a tailspin!
Steve: Alex, it’s PICKLEs. People love ‘em, but they’ll be fine without ‘em for a few hours.
Alex: Oh no, Steve. You’ve never seen the kind of panic that starts when Aunt Mabel’s PICKLEs aren’t available.
Alex: It’s like the sun stops shining, the grass stops growing, and people start looking at each other like they’re gonna ACTION each other.
Alex: It’s a disaster waiting to happen!
Steve: I think you’ve got a wild imagination, Alex. But alright, let’s go get the PICKLEs
Alex:(Confidently) I’ve got everything I need. First, a map.
Alex: (Pulls out a wrinkled map) Now, this here is TOWN… and this is Aunt Mabel’s house. But it’s not just about getting to Aunt Mabel’s house.
Alex: Steve. We need a strategy. A route. A backup plan. What if the PICKLEs aren’t ready? What if Aunt Mabel’s out of CONTAINER?
Steve: (Amused) Alex, Aunt Mabel’s always got PICKLEs. And she’s never out of CONTAINERs.
Alex: (Seriously) And that’s why we need a backup plan. If the PICKLEs aren’t ready, we need to know what to do.
Alex: We can’t just stand there with empty hands. I’ll have to improvise.
Aunt Mabel: Well, what’s all this talk about backup plans and improvising? Sounds like you two are up to something.
Alex: (Standing up straight) Uh, no, no, Aunt Mabel. Just, you know, planning a little... operation. You can never be too careful with PICKLEs.
Aunt Mabel: (Squinting suspiciously) PICKLEs? You two planning something more than just picking up a CONTAINER of PICKLEs?
Steve: (Grinning) Aunt Mabel, Alex’s convinced that if we don’t get your PICKLEs on time, the whole town will collapse into CHAOS.
Alex: (Proudly) And I’m prepared for that. I’ve got maps, backup plans, and even a bag of snacks just in case we get stranded!
Aunt Mabel: (Laughing) Stranded? For PICKLEs?
Alex: Absolutely. You can’t underestimate the power of your PICKLEs, ma’am.
Alex: People get desperate. We’ll be lucky if we make it back with all our limbs intact.
Aunt Mabel: (Smirking) I think you’re exaggerating just a bit, Alex. But, just in case, let me make sure you’re properly equipped.
Aunt Mabel: (Teasing) Here you go, Alex. Just a CONTAINER of PICKLEs. Nothing to be scared of.
Aunt Mabel: But you better not drop it. those PICKLEs are more precious than VALUED in this town.
Alex: (Grabbing the CONTAINER eagerly) Oh, I’ll protect it with my life, Aunt Mabel.
Alex: I’ll keep it safe. Not a scratch, not a bump. I’ll treat it like VALUED.
Steve: (Laughing) You really are taking this overboard, aren’t you, Alex?
Alex: (Proudly) Overboard? This is just the beginning, Steve. I’m talking preparedness.
Aunt Mabel: (Chuckling) You boys have fun with your “MISSION,” but remember, PICKLEs are best enjoyed with a little humor and a lot of love.
Alex: Oh, we’ll be back for more PICKLEs soon enough, Aunt Mabel.
Alex: Just wait ‘til we’re famous for completing the PICKLE MISSION. We’ll have statues in the town square!
Steve: I’m sure the people of TOWN will be so thankful for your heroic PICKLE retrieval Alex.
Aunt Mabel: (Putting her hands on her hips) You two have your fun.
Aunt Mabel: But don’t forget, those PICKLEs are only a part of the MISSION. The true MISSION is coming back for breakfast.
Alex: (Nods) Right! A true MISSION requires sustenance!
Steve: (Laughing) And a little bit of sense!
Alex: (As he heads for the door, still holding the CONTAINER ) Alright, Steve. Let’s go. We’ve got PICKLEs to deliver, CHAOSto avoid, and snacks to eat.
(bird screech)
Alex: Aunt Mabel, just promise me if anything goes wrong, you’ll improvise.
Aunt Mabel: (Laughs) Don’t you worry, Alex. You’ll never find a PICKLE MISSION more successful than mine!
Aunt Mabel: (Muttering to herself) PICKLEs… and now MISSIONs… Men and their wild ideas.

MAID: (open the front door) Welcome home, milady.
MISS: (walk inside) Sorry. I was gone for several days. Anything new?
MAID: No. Nothing at all. We've just had a few guests.
MAID: The bird reporter, the fairy that lives nearby...
MISS: Same as always.
MAID: And...
MAID: The young mistress brought her boyfriend.
(record scratch)

BOY1: (enter Stage Left) I am a god of the back door. A god of impairments. God of Noh, god of outcasts, god of stars...
Meanwhile MAID: (walk around pretending to clean everything)
BOY1: And boyfriend of SYSNAME.
MISS: Listen here. There are rumors going around the village of you abducting little girls, you know?
BOY1: Ah hah hah! Sounds like quite the misunderstanding I should clear up.
BOY1: I don't just like little girls. I also like grown-ups just fine. Like OLDNAME for one.
SIS: (enter Stage Left) Are you reeeaaally trying to defend yourself?
MISS: Listen, SYSNAME. I wouldn't complain if a boyfriend you brought home was a murderer or a terrorist or something...
MISS: But a TITLE1 is a step too far.
SIS: Huuuh? And why is that? You're on pretty good terms with OLDNAME, aren't you?
MISS: Sure, but we're not dating. What exactly do you even like about BOYNAME, SYSNAME?
SIS: Huh? What makes you think I "like" her?
(vine boom)
SIS: I just agreed to make her my boyfriend cuz she makes it easy to TASK.
MISS: Pretty rude of you to just use her to TASK, isn't it?
BOY1: Heh... I get to be her boyfriend.
MISS: G-good for you...
SIS: *sigh* You know I have plenty of other boyfriends besides BOYNAME, right?
SIS: There're those kids who play outside the temple school, obviously.
SIS: And the old man at the sweets shop is my boyfriend cuz he gives me his test DESSERT.
MISS: Don't just-
SIS: DEMON is my boyfriend who plays with me. NAMEAUD is my boyfriend who sleeps with me...
MISS: Right. Remind me to kill NAMEAUD after this play.
MISS: And that... DEMON, was it? Why haven't you introduced them to your sister?
SIS: Why the hell should I?
MISS: Hey now! If they seem nice, I'll at least pull out some DESSERT or something.
BOY1: Hmm? Sister-in-law, you've never met DEMON?
MISS: Call me that again, and I'll kill you as well.

MISS: SYSNAME, go with that one.
SIS: Huuuh? Where's this coming from?

BOY1: What are you saying, NAMEAUD? You're embarrassing me in front of everyone.
MISS: I'm not talking to you. Ah, wait... we're all larping as different characters right now...
MISS: Hey!! Why is this stupid script so confusing?!
SIS: Damn, NAMEAUD, you really suck at roleplaying.
BOY2: You can say that again.
MISS: Come on! I'm being serious here, dammit!
MISS: DEMON, what about you? Are you going to marry my SYSNAME?
BOY2: Huh?! M-marry?! (panicking)
BOY2: Do you mind if I do a check real quick?
SIS: Barf. No one wants to talk to their TITLE2 about marriage stuff.
BOY2: (pull something out of pocket) If you roll a NUM on this 500-sided dice, you get married.
MISS: That's basically a ball, huh?
SIS: Here goes. (lol) (throw die)
(gameshow ding)
SIS: Ah. I rolled a NUM.

BOY2: The game master and a player got married, so the players... win?
BOY2: By the way, does that actually mean I'm marrying BOYNAME, or...?
SIS: Huh?! My boyfriends are marrying each other all of a sudden?!
BOY1: The one you really want to marry is your dear big sister, isn't it? I can tell.
SIS: What the hell gave you that idea!?
BOY2: God damn, this TITLE1 creeps me out.
Meanwhile BOY1: I've already got a love triangle in mind...
SIS: If big sis is NAMEAUD, but my boyfriend who's my boyfriend's boyfriend is also myself, does that mean me and big sis are also married? (scream)
MISS: SYSNAME is spiraling into madness!

aww
emotional piano music
BOY: Why, what's wrong?
GIRL: I think I am getting really dizzy from playing GAME.
BOY: Oh no, BRUH. You should definitely rest on your BED.
BOY: What have you been doing that caused you to be this dizzy?
GIRL: I am not sure, but, this should just be because I have been playing GAME for HRS.
Music Stops
vine boom
BOY: Oh, I see... That... definitely does not sound like a good thing to do.
BOY: Playing GAME for HRS straight... what were you thinking?
GIRL: Be quiet for a bit, my ears are ringing... can you just get me some MEDS?
BOY: Oh, yeah sure... (Gets MEDS from kitchen)
BOY: Here you go. (give medicine to girl)
Meanwhile GIRL: (Takes MEDS and looks at it)

Teleport THOUGHT to Stage Right
Guitar Music 1
THOUGHT: What are you doing, GIRL?
Meanwhile BOY: (Continue playing GAME)
GIRL: Huh? Who are you?
THOUGHT: Who am I? I'm you're inner thoughts. Your conscience!
THOUGHT: Come on GIRL, really? MEDS? You know that's not good for you!
THOUGHT: Don't you think the best medicine is Natural Medicine?
GIRL: Maybe... but this really feels bad! Can't I just have a teeny bit of MEDS?
THOUGHT: Even better, let's fix your dizziness by just doing ACTIVITY!
GIRL: Hmm, let me think for a sec...
GIRL: Yes, that makes perfect sense!
GIRL: I just have to ACTIVITY outside and that should fix my dizziness!
THOUGHT: That's the spirit.
THOUGHT: It might fix your LOW SELF ESTEEM too!
THOUGHT: Well, I've done my job-- helping you do the right thing.
THOUGHT: BYE! ...
Teleport THOUGHT to Backstage
happy music 1
GIRL: Hey, BRUH. Come here for a second!
BOY: Oh, what's up, are you feeling better now? (looks at the MEDS on GIRL's hand)
BOY: Uhhh... hey, why haven't you taken your MEDS, BRUH?
GIRL: I just had a deep conversation with my conscience while I was contemplating on these MEDS.
GIRL: (shrugs and throw the MEDS) You know what, I don't need MEDS to cure my dizziness!
BOY: Then what is your conscience suggesting so you can feel better?
GIRL: Me and my conscience has concluded that I should just go ACTIVITY outside.
GIRL: That should cure me immediately!
BOY: What? Are you sure that will cure you? Sounds so sus...
BOY: TikTok said PROCEDURE would fix my fear of SNAKES but that ended up being fake science!
GIRL: Come on, it makes so much sense that ACTIVITY outside will cure me immediately (Drag BOY to exit Front Door)
BOY: Wait, I seriously doubt this is a good ideaaaaaaa... (Get dragged out of the door)

Teleport THOUGHT to Center Stage
THOUGHT: (To audience) Well, just so everyone knows, if you follow this cure, I should warn you.
THOUGHT: We are not responsible for any harm or injuries you may receive if you go ACTIVITY outside when you are feeling dizzy after playing GAME for HRS straight.
THOUGHT: So if you are a normal person, but is somehow appalled by your own conscience and do not like sleeping on your BED....
THOUGHT: (Pick up MEDS and show them to camera) Order MEDS now.
