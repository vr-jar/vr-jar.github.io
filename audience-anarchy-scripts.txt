WOMAN: Come get your out of control dog for crying out loud!
WOMAN: (Sneeze) Achoo! (Leave)
TRAINER: Meh, he'll be fine. My POODLE is very graceful.
OWNER: I can't look at another CUPCAKE without thinking of my husband Dave.
(70s music)
OWNER: (Looking at TRAINER flirtatiously) But you're not a CUPCAKE...
TRAINER: Are you saying you like to look at me?
OWNER: Do you work out?

MODERATOR: Candidates, let's address the elephant in the room.
MODERATOR: Millions of American citizens are concerned about the rising cost of prescription drugs.
MODERATOR: Will you do anything to make healthcare more affordable? Mr. Cletus Williams, let's start with you.
USA Anthem Music
COWBOY: Ladies and gentle folk of the Jury, I mean America,
COWBOY: This country is in a no-good state.
COWBOY: It reminds me of that one time I wrangled a cow that done got its BODY PART blown off by a FRENCH WEAPON.
COWBOY: But listen here.
COWBOY: It is my humble belief that simpler is always better.
COWBOY: (Point at ALIEN) My opponent here would have you believe that their space-age alien technology is what you need.
COWBOY: But I beg you to reconsider.
COWBOY: (Point at ALIEN) But them there is the wrong kind of Alien.
COWBOY: One time, Aliens just like flew over my Uncle Bob's farm and stole his cows and does God knows what to them.
ALIEN: We VERB your cattle and eat their BODY PART. It makes us S T R O N G E R.
COWBOY: Now folks, I sure as shootin’ ain’t no space traveller
COWBOY: but I reckon I’m not feeling too confident about handing our nation's reins to a varmint like that (Point at ALIEN)...
COWBOY: whose idea of a good time is suckin' the BODY PART off of some poor, unsuspecting cow.
COWBOY: Also, you should vote for me because I like GUN.

MODERATOR: XN-74, your response?
USA Anthem Music
ALIEN: Greetings, Earthlings. I am XN-74 from the planet ZORTRON.

COWBOY: Hold up, did you say you have 324,264 brothers and sisters?
ALIEN: Affirmative.
COWBOY: Is your entire species related or somethin like that?
ALIEN: Affirmative.
ALIEN: My species reproduces through inter-breeding with blood relatives and is therefore superior.
COWBOY: (Nod your head to the ALIEN and the audience, give a thumbs up)
ALIEN: Our species will begin our invasion of Earth by dominating the United States of America....
ALIEN: The greatest country on Earth! (Hold up hands in celebration)
ALIEN: We will enslave all sentient life on this planet. But if you vote for me, you will be given one of the "good" slave jobs.
ALIEN: For example. DOING LAUNDRY. (Hold up hands in celebration)
ALIEN: All nations will be destroyed. But if you vote for me, we will start by destroying... the FRENCH nation. (Hold up hands in celebration)
ALIEN: All humans who submit to your ZORTRON overlords will also be given a free MASSAGE DEVICE. (Hold up hands in celebration)
ALIEN: All humans who dissent will be destroyed, especially the FRENCH! (Hold up hands in celebration)
Applause
MODERATOR: Interesting points on both sides. However, we are almost out of time.
MODERATOR: Mr. Cletus Williams, do you have any closing remarks?
USA Anthem Music
COWBOY: Well folks, the choice is clear. A vote for me is a vote for good old-fashioned American values, like cows, and CAPITALISM.
COWBOY: I stand for guns, freedom, guns, CAPITALISM, and not getting our BODY PARTS eaten by extraterrestrial forces.
COWBOY: However, I do concede that the love between brother and sister is strong.
COWBOY: But the love between a man and his GUN is stronger.
COWBOY: Your honor, I rest my case.
Applause
MODERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Williams. XN-74, your closing remarks?
USA Anthem Music
ALIEN: Our ultimate goal is not destruction, but construction.
ALIEN: From the plasma-scorched ashes of this miserable sphere of rock you call "Earth", we will rebuild a new society,
ALIEN: Built on the slave labor of humans, and fueled by INTERNAL ORGAN burgers...
ALIEN: which is what we call cow hamburgers made from the INTERNAL ORGAN of humans.
ALIEN: I mean cows! I meant to say the INTERNAL ORGAN of cows.
ALIEN: They are extremely delicious and will be given to all the "Good" humans who work hard and don't incite an uprising against ZORTRON.
ALIEN: The "bad" humans will be put to work in the burger factory.
ALIEN: (Point at audience) Puny Earthlings! Look under your chairs! Everyone gets a free MASSAGE DEVICE!
ALIEN: (Hold up hands in celebration) For the glory of ZORTRON!

DETECTIVE: (Looking out the window) It's late one November night.
DETECTIVE: (Walk up to audience) The cigarette smoke swirls around my apartment like the puzzles swim around my mind.
DETECTIVE: I'm knee-deep in a labyrinth of dead ends and unanswered questions.
DETECTIVE: Who exactly was the Big Apple Burglar?
DETECTIVE: Why do they steal priceless jewels and leave little notes behind?
DETECTIVE: I had a hunch that the burglar was actually a SNAKE wearing a burglar costume, but... that trail went cold.
DETECTIVE: Imagine that. A SNAKE wearing a cute little burglar costume.
DETECTIVE: (Smoke cigarette, gag, cough) Makes me sick to my stomach.
Knocking on door
DETECTIVE: (Calling out) Who's there?
PIZZA GUY: Pizza delivery.
DETECTIVE: Come on... the door's open.
PIZZA GUY: (Enter) Here's your personal pan pizza, sir. Extra TOPPING.

DETECTIVE: (Step forward and speak to audience again) He walked into my office wearing a goofy Pizza delivery outfit.
DETECTIVE: And LEGS like CHOPSTICKS that went... ALL the way up.
DETECTIVE: They say crime is like a big, juicy pizza, overflowing with TOPPING.
DETECTIVE: Except instead of pizza, it's New York City.
DETECTIVE: And instead of TOPPING, it's crime.
DETECTIVE: And the cheese? That's the RATS.
DETECTIVE: But something was off about this personal pan pizza with extra TOPPING... I could feel it.
DETECTIVE: (Return to scene, talk to PIZZA GUY) How much do I owe you?
PIZZA GUY: That will be 15 dollars.
DETECTIVE: (Taking money out of wallet) Here, kid. Keep the change.
PIZZA GUY: Thanks, have a nice day (Begin to move toward the door)
PIZZA GUY: (Remembering something) Say, detective... you wouldn't happen to have any JEWELS laying around the office, would you?
DETECTIVE: JEWELS? Kid, don't get me started on JEWELS. (Bite into a slice of pizza)
DETECTIVE: (Talk with mouth full) I'm hot on the case of the Big Apply Burglar, and all that dastardly thief does is steal JEWELS.
DETECTIVE: Except the trail's gone cold... (Spit out the pizza) Just like this pizza.
DETECTIVE: Say, why'd it take so long for you to get here? This pizza is stone cold like MY MOTHER.
PIZZA GUY: Sorry, detective. I had to take a quick, uh, "detour" on the way over.
PIZZA GUY: ... at the gun store. (Take out a gun and point it at the detective)
Vine boom
Noir music 3
DETECTIVE: (Gasp) You. You're the Big Apple Burglar!
PIZZA GUY: Finally figured it out, eh, detective?
DETECTIVE: (Step forward and speak to audience again) It all made sense now.
DETECTIVE: The pizza boxes we found at the crime scene. The TOPPING on the victim's bodies.
DETECTIVE: It was right under my nose the entire time.
DETECTIVE: But I wasn't about to let this ADJECTIVE-NOSE little creep get away this time...
DETECTIVE: and besides... I had something the thief wanted that was more valuable than priceless JEWELS.
PIZZA GUY: (To DETECTIVE) You should have put assembled all the slices of this mystery sooner, detective.
PIZZA GUY: Now, I'm the one who's going to leave YOU a fat tip...
PIZZA GUY: The tip of my bullet in your chest.
DETECTIVE: Oh, but Pizza guy... or should I say, "Big Apple Burglar"... I have some information that will interest you very much.
PIZZA GUY: Oh yeah? Nice try. Stop stalling for time.
PIZZA GUY: I'm going to silence you like I silence the notifications on my phone when my wife tries to call me about IMPORTANT BUSINESS.
PIZZA GUY: Besides, the only thing I care about is stealing all of the JEWELS in this city...
DETECTIVE: ... so that you can buy your SNAKE back from the crime boss, Big KAHUNA Frankie?
Noir music 2
PIZZA GUY: (Lowering gun) H-how do you know about that?
PIZZA GUY: How do you kn ow that Big KAHUNA Frankie, New York City's seventh-biggest crime boss, is holding my SNAKE hostage?
DETECTIVE: (Smoking) It wasn't easy to find that out, even for a detective like me.
DETECTIVE: I had to BRIBE a lot of guys.
DETECTIVE: What can I say... if you follow the trail of pizza, and BRIBE enough guys... that's classic detective work.
DETECTIVE: I may not agree with your methods, and I don't like your ADJECTIVE NOSE, but it seems like I don't have a much of a choice, now, do I?
PIZZA GUY: Listen, man. If you help me get my SNAKE back from Big KAHUNA Frankie, I'll return all the JEWELS. I swear it.
PIZZA GUY: I don't even like JEWELS. I just like pizza.... and murder.
DETECTIVE: Seems like you and me have more alike than I thought.
DETECTIVE: (Taking hat and coat from rack) Let's hit the road. If the cops ask any questions... I'll BRIBE them. (Leave)

MODERATOR: You may be the owner of the largest mega-corporation in the world,
MODERATOR: Which brings billions of pounds of delicious HONEY (and other candy products) to the children of the world,
MODERATOR: But in this debate room-- it is I, who am God.

Meanwhile JOHN: (Mockingly imitate the MODERATOR's words)

GAMER: What happened to them? One day, they were all just mysteriously... gone?

Peaceful fantasy music
WIZARD: Greetings, DEVOURER OF CHAOS, Sorcerer of the Ninth Realm.
SORCERER: Salutations, uh... I'm sorry, what was your name again? I'm terrible with names.
WIZARD: MERLIN. My name is MERLIN. We attended magic school together for like... 5 years.
SORCERER: Ah, PigFarts university. I remember it like it was a century ago.
WIZARD: Ha! I believe it was two centuries ago!
SORCERER: (Laughing) Who's counting! Haha!
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Laughing together)
SORCERER: Hey, can I ask you something? You ever turn your staff into a snake just for fun?
WIZARD: Just for fun? I guess you can say that. WINK! (Wink at SORCERER)
Alien teleport, Magic sound, Teleport HUMAN to CENTER STAGE
HUMAN: (Surprised, confused!) Wha--What happened? (Look around) Where am I?
HUMAN: (Thinking hard) The last thing I remember was... driving through a FRANCHISE drive-through?
HUMAN: (Looking around) And now I'm in a fantasy world full of... Wizards?
WIZARD: Greetings, good fellow! I am MERLIN, wizard of this realm.
SORCERER: And I am DEVOURER OF CHAOS, Sorcerer of the Ninth Realm.
HUMAN: I must have been Isekai-ed into a completely different universe!
HUMAN: I mean uh... "realm."
HUMAN: (Pointing) And is that a... MUSHROOM in the distance?
SORCERER: (Looking over shoulder) Oh yeah, the MUSHROOM. We have plenty of those here.
WIZARD: You're not from this realm, are you, stranger?
SORCERER: Does your world not have MUSHROOM?
HUMAN: No. But we do have FRANCHISE.
SORCERER: (Struggling to pronounce word) ...FRANCHISE? What manner of sorcery is that?
WIZARD: I think I know a spell called "Abra-ka-FRANCHISE".
SORCERER: Do you want to try it?
WIZARD: Couldn't hurt.
WIZARD: (Channeling a magical incantation) Abra-ka-FRANCHISE!
Meanwhile SORCERER: (Channeling a magical incantation) Abra-ka-FRANCHISE!
Thunder, Magic sound
Peaceful fantasy music
SORCERER: (Surprised) Oh! That's silly. (Feeling mouth) It turned my teeth into MATERIAL.
WIZARD: Fascinating! I shall write this down in my scroll. (Pull out a scroll and write in it)
HUMAN: Hmm, I was driving my VEHICLE through the FRANCHISE drive-through...
HUMAN: Have you wizards seen my VEHICLE come out of some kind of portal, or rift, or something?
WIZARD: VEHICLE? Indeed! A strange monstrosity labeled "VEHICLE" manifested itself in the forest just hours ago.
HUMAN: Where can I find it? Perhaps I can use it to return to my world.
WIZARD: Good luck with that. We saw a gang of goblins loot that VEHICLE almost immediately.
SORCERER: Looked like they were trying to convert it into some kind of battle-wagon tricked out with enchanted VEHICLE armor.
WIZARD: They're still working on it but believe me, so far, it looks pretty sick.
HUMAN: Darn. How am I going to get back to my Earth, now?
WIZARD: Earth? Why, you're standing on it, dear, boy! Ha! (Laugh to self)
SORCERER: (Laughing together) This poor chap doesn't even know the four elements of which our realm is composed! What a fool! Ha ha ha!
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Laugh together, mocking the HUMAN)
HUMAN: (Not amused) I do happen to know the elements, Wizards. In fact, I'm a chemistry student.
HUMAN: And on my planet, which is called EARTH, we have 118 elements.
SORCERER: Oh yeah? Name every element.
HUMAN: Okay. Uh, Hydrogen... Helium...
WIZARD: (Breaking out in laughter) "Helium!" Ha! You're definitely making that up.
Meanwhile SORCERER: (Break out in laughter and point at the HUMAN mockingly)
SORCERER: Ha! Every knows the four elements are Earth, Water, Fire, and ELEMENT!
HUMAN: You know what, I don't need this. I'm gonna go find a way back home.
SORCERER: Okay, chump! Good luck finding your way out of this forest with all the "CREATUREs" lurking about!
WIZARD: (Quietly to SORCERER) Shh, don't give him any hints.
HUMAN: You Wizards are real jerks (Start to leave, but hesitate) Wait... did you say CREATURE?
SORCERER: Why yes, there are CREATURE all throughout these woods!
SORCERER: Hiding behind every MUSHROOM, in fact!
HUMAN: Why do you say it like that? Should I be worried about these CREATUREs?
SORCERER: (Coy) I don't know... should you?
HUMAN: Well, when you say it like that, I'm not so sure I want to go venturing off without some protection...
HUMAN: Are you guys going to help me or what?
WIZARD: (Walk up to Human) You know, I feel bad for you, Human.
WIZARD: With your flimsy little arms and fragile BODY PART (Fiddle with HUMAN's BODY PART)
HUMAN: What's wrong with my BODY PART?
WIZARD: Allow me to cast a spell of moderate protection.
SORCERER: Yeah, that's fair. If you die, who will we mock for our amusement?
HUMAN: (Pondering) I've never been under a magic spell before.
HUMAN: Unless you count listening to SONG nonstop when I was in high school.
WIZARD: What a coincidence. That's exactly the incantation to this spell.
SORCERER: (Gather near the human) Let's begin the spell. Ready, MERLIN?
WIZARD: Ready, DEVOURER OF CHAOS.
WIZARD: (Chanting, waving arms around) SONG, SONG, SONG

Jazz music 1
JACOB: (Fiddling in kitchen) Did you eat all the PIZZA ROLLS?
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Sitting on couch playing on phone)
TREVOR: (Sitting on couch playing on phone) No way. I didn't eat what was left of your delicious PIZZA ROLLS.
JACOB: Are you sure? I could have sworn there were at least several PIZZA ROLLS left.
TREVOR: (Sitting on couch) Yeah yeah whatever. Hey man. Check out this pic. (Hold out cellphone)
Meanwhile JACOB: (Do stuff in the kicthen)
JACOB: (Shielding eyes, looking away) Oh no. Nope. Not falling for that again.
JACOB: (Wagging finger at TREVOR) Nuh uh
TREVOR: What? (Wiggle phone, invitingly) Come on, It's a funny pic, check this out.
JACOB: Last time you wanted to show me a so-called "funny pic", it was a picture of TERRIBLE THING.
TREVOR: Okay, I admin. That was highly uncool of me. Even if it was a little funny.
TREVOR: But I promise, this isn't like that. C'mon, check out this pic. It's worth it.
JACOB: (Disbelief) Oh yeah? What's it a picture of, then?
TREVOR: (Holding out phone and not even looking at it) It's... a picture of my PETANIMAL.
TREVOR: (Unconvincingly) It's... a meme of my PETANIMAL, actually!
JACOB: (Disbelief) What does this "Meme" say? What's the text on it?
TREVOR: I'm not gonna spoil it by reading it out loud. You have to see for yourself. That's the whole point.
JACOB: No! Before I commit to engaging with that meme, I need definitive proof that it's not a picture of TERRIBLE THING.
JACOB: Or anything else of that nature.
MARTHA: (Enter) What's all this commotion? And are there any PIZZA ROLLS left?
TREVOR: (To MARTHA) Hey, Martha. Check out this pic on my phone. (Hold out phone)
Meanwhile MARTHA: (Don't look at the phone just yet)
JACOB: (Urgently) DO NOT do it!
MARTHA: What's the matter? Why can't I just look at that pic?
JACOB: (Shielding MARTHA, whispering to her) It's a prank, it's probably a picture of HORRIBLE THING or something like that.
JACOB: Don't encourage this. Just ignore it. Save yourself. You're still pure. You can get away.
TREVOR: Don't listen to Jacob. He's just hangry for PIZZA ROLLS.
Meanwhile JACOB: (Gesture for MARTHA to leave the room)
TREVOR: (Pointing to phone) This is just a meme of my PETANIMAL. That's all. It's pretty funny.
TREVOR: So instead of questioning my motivations, why don't you check it out yourself? (Hold out phone)
JACOB: Martha, for the love of PIZZA ROLLS, if you value your eyeballs, don't look at that PETANIMAL meme.
MARTHA: You guys have some kind of problem you need to work out. I'm not sure I want to get involved.
JACOB: Thank you!
TREVOR: You know what? Don't look at this meme of my PETANIMAL.
TREVOR: It's not like I put a lot of time and effort into it.
TREVOR: Studying the greatest memes and learning from them to craft the perfect, witty, ironic meme.
TREVOR: Raising a PETANIMAL from birth. (Turn away sadly)
JACOB: (Throwing arms up in exasperation) Typical. This is so typical.
JACOB: (To MARTHA, but loud) This is classic Trevor-reverse-psychology.
JACOB: (Suddenly remembering) AND! Last time he said he raised a SNAKE. Remember the SNAKE thing?
JACOB: But it was all an elaborate excuse to get you to look at a video of a SNAKE IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
JACOB: (Up close to TREVOR) You're a sick individual.
TREVOR: (Holding up phone) Check it out.
Meanwhile JACOB: (Shield your eyes and don't look at the phone) No!
MARTHA: This is ridiculous. Now I'm super intrigued. I simply must see this PETANIMAL meme.
TREVOR: (Coy) You sure?
MARTHA: Yeah. Sure. Show me.
TREVOR: You trust me?
MARTHA: Yeah.
TREVOR: (To JACOB) See, Martha trusts me.
JACOB: (Facing away proudly) That's a mistake.
MARTHA: Oh, don't be such a coward. Besides, I'm so desensitized to videos of IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION at this point, who cares?
MARTHA: I've even made a few IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION memes myself.
MARTHA: (Grabbing TREVOR's phone) Let me see that.
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Martha takes your phone to look at it)
TREVOR: Check it out!
MARTHA: (Taking a moment to read the meme) Okay.
JACOB: (Watching in anticipation) Well? Did you fall for it?
MARTHA: I mean, it's just a picture of a PETANIMAL DOING STUFF.
MARTHA: And it has the caption, MEME CAPTION
JACOB: No way. Let me see this. (Grab phone from MARTHA and look at it)
MARTHA: It's true.
JACOB: (Reading meme out loud) MEME CAPTION.
JACOB: Well, I'll be GOBSMACKED and flabbergasted.
MARTHA: Nice meme, Trevor. (High five TREVOR)
Meanwhile TREVOR: (High five MARTHA)
JACOB: (Holding up phone) Okay. What's the catch with this?
TREVOR: (Coy) Jacob, my friend. There is virtually no catch. There's barely anything that should worry you.
JACOB: Well, I guess my day has been slightly improved by looking at this cute little PETANIMAL... (Thinking) wait a second!
JACOB: (Increasingly suspicious) Why are you being so coy? WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NOTHING SIGNIFICANT"?
JACOB: (Strangle TREVOR) WHAT DID YOU DO?
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Get strangled) Bleck! Gurk!
MARTHA: Stop! Let him go! (Pull JACOB away from TREVOR)
Meanwhile JACOB: (MARTHA pulls you away from TREVOR)
JACOB: (To TREVOR) Speak, you fiend.
TREVOR: (Maniacally) You cursed, my good fellow! By gazing upon the forbidden PETANIMAL, and speaking the incantation, you are cursed to die!
TREVOR: Cursed to die... in sixty seconds! (Evil laughter, highly amused)
MARTHA: What the heck, man!
JACOB: What kind of "The Ring" garbage is this? (To audience) Is this seriously the best conclusion the author of this skit could think of?
MARTHA: (To TREVOR) What's wrong with you? Why do this? What's your motivation?
TREVOR: (Serious) In a word.... "chaos."
JACOB: (Strangle TREVOR) You jerk! You lift this curse right now! Or I'll make you IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION!
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Getting strangled) There's nothing-- I can do-- !
MARTHA: (Looking at watch) Wait... it's definitely been at least a minute since we looked at the meme.
JACOB: (Stop strangling TREVOR) It's been a minute? And we're not dead?
JACOB: Perhaps... there is no curse?
TREVOR: (Laughing to self)
JACOB: (To TREVOR, playfully, laughing) Oh Trevor, you jerk. You had me all worried for nothing. Again!
MARTHA: (Laughing playfully) You really are a gullible little guy.
JACOB: (Sighing, putting arm around TREVOR) Classic Trevor.
MARTHA: (Looking at watch) But just to be safe, I think we should give it a few more seconds, though.
MARTHA: And if we're not dead by then, we can-- (YOU SUDDENLY DIE)
Church bell
Tense cinematic music
TREVOR: (Point and laugh at MARTHA's corpse) Hahaha! Another soul falls, in the name of PETANIMAL!
JACOB: (Increasingly building rage) Trevor... when I die... I'm going to haunt you so hard you will with you were never born!
JACOB: I'm gonna-- (YOU SUDDENLY DIE)
Church bell
Lacrimosa music
TREVOR: (Pick up phone from MARTHA's corpse, thinking to self) Now... what to make for my next cursed meme?
TREVOR: Oh I know... (typing on phone) I'll make a meme about SOMETHING
TREVOR:  And send it to everyone I know on discord... right now! (Hold phone up to audience)

HOST: Patricia, whenever you're ready, take it away!

MOTHER: (Endearing) You've been such a good boy this year, Timmy. What would you like for your birthday!
CHILD: I want a pet doggy!
MOTHER: A dog? That's a big responsibility. Okay... but you have to promise to take care of that doggy!
CHILD: I will, I promise!
MOTHER: Make sure you always remember to feed it... "INEDIBLE OBJECT"...
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants) I said, remember to feed your dog "INEDIBLE OBJECT". (Pause for a moment)
CHILD: I will, mom!
MOTHER: (To CHILD) And always take it for a walk... after it eats the "INEDIBLE OBJECT"...
CHILD: Yeah! (Pause awkwardly)
HOST: Contestants, go ahead and ring in whenever you notice something wrong with this scene...
TREVOR: (Watch the actors really intensely for a second)
CHILD: Mommy, are dogs supposed to eat "INEDIBLE OBJECT"?
MOTHER: Why yes Timmy, INEDIBLE OBJECT is made specifically for dogs to eat, inside their mouths.
MOTHER: (Rub stomach, stare at contestants) Mmm, INEDIBLE OBJECT!
Music stops, Gameshow ring
TREVOR: (Point at actors) I know what's wrong.
TREVOR: You don't really need to walk your dog as long as you have enough CLEANING SUPPLIES.
TREVOR: And they have plenty of CLEANING SUPPLIES!
HOST: No, that's... (Utterly confused) What?

TREVOR: He hasn't really been a good boy this year. Just look into his eyes. He's done unspeakable things.

ALEXA: I don't like her face.
HOST: Here's a hint: It's something about the DOG FOOD.
Gameshow ring
TREVOR: INEDIBLE OBJECT doesn't go in your mouth, God gave you a specific hole for that.
HOST: Close enough. I guess you earn one point.
HOST: You people are weird. Okay, here's your next scenario.
HOST: Hopefully this one is a bit easier, but I doubt it, since that was the FIRST round...

CHILD: Mommy?
MOTHER: What is it, Timmy?
CHILD: Where do babies come from?
MOTHER: Well, you see, Timmy, when mommy and daddy love each other very much, they...
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants) go to CHAIN RESTAURANT and eat SPECIAL INGREDIENT.
MOTHER: (To TIMMY) and nine months later, a baby is born!
CHILD: Wow! SPECIAL INGREDIENT? I had no idea!
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants and shrug) Yup!... Totally true!

HOST: That's not correct... seriously?

TREVOR: Which makes sense, because 9 months before our baby was born she was away on a business trip with her boss and his friends.

ALEXA: That's not her real son. The husband swapped out the babies at the hospital and she has no idea.
HOST: None of you are right, let's just move onto the next scenario.

MOTHER: (Take out cellphone, dialing number) 212-802-4444...
MOTHER: (Speaking on phone) Hello, Domino's Pizza? I'd like to order one large pizza pepperoni pizza.
MOTHER: (Staring at contestants) Yes, and a 2 liter of pepsi...
CHILD: (Coughing, vomiting) Mommy... is there supposed to be blood?
MOTHER: Hang in there, Timmy, my son! I'm calling for help right now!
MOTHER: (Talking on phone, speaking very slowly) ... by calling DOMINO'S PIZZA.
MOTHER: (Talking on phone) Why yes, I'll hold...
Music stops, Gameshow ring
TREVOR: She's stupid, if you order on the Domino's app your get a much better deal.

ALEXA: The kid doesn't need that much Pepsi, chugging a regular bottle should fix him up real good.

TREVOR: (Holding up cellphone) I just called 212-802-4444 and it's a TELEPHONE SERVICE.

HUSBAND: (Brushing her hair) How mad are you? Do you want to CHOKE me?
WIFE: (Coy) Maybe I do want to CHOKE you after all you've put me through today.
HUSBAND: (Exiting stage left) Why don't we go upstairs and you can get your revenge for all my... IRRESPONSIBLE THING?

TYPEWRITER: Secret hideout;Somewhere in upstate New York;11AM Friday
TYPEWRITER: Secret agent CODENAME receives a message from HQ...
AGENT: (Pacing around nervously) It's Friday. This is not good. I should have heard from headquarters by now.
AGENT: If I don't receive a message by the end of the day, my mission to DO GOOD DEED could be a complete failure.
AGENT: Was the pizza delivery last night a secret message in disguise? If so, I might have eaten it by accident.
AGENT: (Peek out the window) No sign of any friendly agents. Maybe something went wrong.
AGENT: (Noticing someone outside) Wait a moment. Who's that walking up to the house?
AGENT: Is that....?!
Doorbell
AGENT: (Calling out) One moment!
AGENT: Hmm. This could be a trap. Better take up a tactical position. (Hide behind the couch and point your gun at the door
Doorbell
AGENT: (Calling out) Come on in, the door's open!
MAILMAN: (Enter stage right) Hello? Are you sure it's okay to come inside? This is highly unconventional.
MAILMAN: (Noticing the agent) Oh, hello. I see you have a gun. I'll just be leaving now.
AGENT: Oh, this? It's just a... toy gun.
AGENT: (Lying) You see, I'm a famous movie star named FAMOUS ACTOR. You may have heard of me.
MAILMAN: FAMOUS ACTOR? Never heard of you. But that explanation makes perfect sense.
AGENT: It's my fool-proof-- I mean, totally accurate backstory.
MAILMAN: (Holding a package) Well, FAMOUS ACTOR, I am here to deliver this very important package.
AGENT: A package you say? Well, I have been expecting to receive something today.
AGENT: (Whispering to self) Perhaps this is a message from headquarters in disguise....
MAILMAN: What are you saying? I can't hear you.
AGENT: Oh, nothing. So, do I have to sign for the package or something?
MAILMAN: Let me just confirm your identity real quick.
MAILMAN: (Reading the package label) It says here... Deliver to FAMOUS ACTOR, 1234 STREETNAME street, New York.
AGENT: That's me.
MAILMAN: (Reading the package label) Contains 1 ORDERABLE ITEM from ORDERABLE ITEM.com.
AGENT: (Whispering to self) I didn't order any ORDERABLE ITEM... headquarters must have sent this.
AGENT: (To mail person) Yes, that's my ORDERABLE ITEM.
AGENT: You see, my old ORDERABLE ITEM broke when I tried to use it to REPAIR THING.
MAILMAN: With all due respect, FAMOUS ACTOR, I don't need to hear your entire life story.
MAILMAN: Technically I'm not even supposed to look inside the package. Anyways, here you go. (Hand it over)
Meanwhile AGENT: (Take the package)
AGENT: (Take the package) Thanks. Have a nice day...
Meanwhile MAILMAN: (Exit)
MAILMAN: (Exit)
AGENT: Time to check out this ORDERABLE ITEM and see what secret messages it contains.

AGENT: (Answering phone) Who is this?
NARRATOR: Agent CODENAME, is that you?
AGENT: That depends. Who's asking? Who are you?
NARRATOR: My name is not important. What is important is that you do not open that package.
AGENT: You mean this package of ORDERABLE ITEM? How do you know about that?
NARRATOR: Listen closely. That ORDERABLE ITEM contains a CHEMICAL bomb that's set to explode in 60 seconds.
Tense cinematic music
AGENT: A CHEMICAL bomb? That's going to explode in 60 seconds?
AGENT: I just cleaned this room! Now there's going to be CHEMICAL everywhere?
NARRATOR: Focus, agent CODENAME. CHEMICAL on your carpet will be the least of your concerns if you don't dispose of that bomb.
AGENT: What am I supposed to do with this?
NARRATOR: That's for you to figure out. Goodbye, agent CODENAME.
AGENT: (Putting away the phone) They hung up. Darn. Now what am I going to do?
AGENT: (Thinking to self) It's time to make use of my spy training.

Aww
INTERN: That doesn't seem so bad. At least we earned a profitable amount of CURRENCY, right?
BOSS: You imbecile! Our company needs to be making more and MORE CURRENCY each quarter!
INTERN: But why?

SALESPERSON: As for who I am, you can call me Elric the Elf.
WANDERER: Well, what do you want from me, Elric the Elf?
SALESPERSON: I happen to have something that might interest you greatly.
SALESPERSON: It's an insurance policy, specifically designed for travelers like yourself who find themselves lost in the forest.
WANDERER: An insurance policy? Is that really necessary?
WANDERER: Besides, I don't have much money on me right now.
SALESPERSON: Ah, but can you really put a price on peace of mind?
SALESPERSON: You're lucky it was I who appeared in the middle of these woods, and not something more sinister...
SALESPERSON: But with this policy, you'll be protected against all sorts of unforeseen dangers and mishaps.
WANDERER: I don't know... I spent all my money on BUYABLE ITEM and my parents won't increase my allowance.
SALESPERSON: It's a very reasonably priced policy. And the benefits highly outweigh the costs.
SALESPERSON: Allow me to elaborate. (Point at the floor)
SALESPERSON: What if you encounter a pit full of CREATUREs? If you fall in, well, you can imagine what might happen.
WANDERER: Oh. Would you say there are many pits full of CREATURE in the woods?
SALESPERSON: Most certainly! And what about a group of TYPE OF PERSON people, who prey on strangers in broad daylight?
WANDERER: Good heavens! I had no idea that TYPE OF PERSON posed that kind of danger!
SALESPERSON: Sorry to scare you, but yes, it's very true.
SALESPERSON: You may also wish to know that NUMBER percent of people who get lost in the woods fall victim to ILLNESS.
WANDERER: Really? ILLNESS? Out in these woods?
SALESPERSON: Of course, ILLNESS is mostly linked to genetics.... (Lean in to tell a secret)
SALESPERSON: But between you and me, I suspect a strong correlation between ILLNESS and FUN ACTIVITY here in the woods.
WANDERER: FUN ACTIVITY in these very woods? Now why would I be doing that?
SALESPERSON: You might come across a TYPE OF PERSON who wants to FUN ACTIVITY. You know, peer pressure.
WANDERER: I suppose if I saw a TYPE OF PERSON doing FUN ACTIVITY then I might be inclined to join in...
SALESPERSON: Exactly! So you'll want an insurance policy to protect you in the event of FUN ACTIVITY ILLNESS.
WANDERER: Well when you put it like that, I would be silly not to have insurance. Where do I sign?
SALESPERSON: Well, it's such a popular policy that I ran out of scrolls.
SALESPERSON: But for now, you can sign my BODY PART. Here's a pen! (Hold out a pen)
WANDERER: (Take the pen and sign the BODY PART) There you go!

WANDERER: (Fall down) Oh no! I've fallen into a pit!
WANDERER: And it's full of... CREATURE?
WANDERER: Elric! Help! My insurance covers this, right?

(Courtroom music)
TYPEWRITER: Court Case #112389;Becky Brown v. David Dickson
BAILIFF: All rise for the honorable Judge NAME!
JUDGE: (enter stage and sit on judge's chair)
(Music stops)
JUDGE: You may be seated.
BAILIFF: Hello, your honor. This is the case of Brown vs. Dickson. 
JUDGE: Thank you, officer. Lets see... (look over files) It says here that Ms. Becky Brown insists that Mr. David Dickson is the father of her AGE month old child.
JUDGE: However, Mr. Dickson claims the kid isn't his.
JUDGE: Ms. Brown, please give the court a brief history on your relationship with Mr. Dickson.
BECKY: (stand up) Yes, your honor. David and I met back in high school and we were sweethearts until a little over AGE months ago. 
BECKY: I'm not sure what happened, but David didn't seem to love me as much when I became pregnant. 
DAVID: That's because you've been sleeping around!
BECKY: I have not! That's not true!
JUDGE: (bang gavel) There will be order in this court! Ms. Brown, please continue.
BECKY: We had been married for about a year, and then David decided to file for divorce days after I told him we we're gonna start a family!
BECKY: I believe he's just avoiding the responsibility of raising child. (sit down)
JUDGE: Mr. Dickson, what is your statement?
DAVID: (stand up) I'm not going to take care of a child that isn't mine. Becky cheated on me!
DAVID: I left for a business trip, and I came back to a positive pregnancy test.
BECKY: Oh PET, do you not remember that night we had together before you left? We were going for HOURS hours!
DAVID: But we've discussed many times that we aren't ready for kids!
BECKY: How do I know you didn't leave to cheat on me then? You've never left on a business trip before!
DAVID: I got a promotion!
BECKY: You work at WORK!
JUDGE: (bang gavel) Order! Order in my court please. Mr. Dickson, is there any further reason why you believe this child isn't yours?
DAVID: Like I just said, Becky and I have talked about how we wanted to wait to have kids many times.
DAVID: We had just moved to CITY, got new jobs, and we wanted to have enough money saved up first. 
DAVID: Plus, even though our date nights would get a little "involved" sometimes, we were always sure to be safe. (sit down)
JUDGE: Well, anything can happen, no matter how safe you think you're being. This is where the DNA test comes in. 
JUDGE: Bailiff, please retrieve the results.
BAILIFF: Yes, your honor. (leave stage)
BECKY: I just want my husband back. I miss the love we had.
DAVID: I bet you miss our love because the real father doesn't want to take care of the kid either. 
BECKY: I told you a thousand times, I didn't cheat!
DAVID: (sarcastically) Yeah, right. I've seen how you look at the neighbor.
BAILIFF: (return to stage, hand imaginary folder to judge) The results, your honor.
JUDGE: (take imaginary folder from bailiff) Thank you. These results were prepared by DNA Diagnostics, and they read as follows...
JUDGE: In the case of Brown v. Dickson, when it comes to the AGE month old child, it has been determined by this court.....
JUDGE: Mr. David Dickson, you........
JUDGE: ANSWER the father.
DAVID: (react to the results)
BECKY: (react to the results)

WIZARD: Hurry along quickly, NAME, and be careful with that box of potions.
MINION: (Enter stage, carrying a box) Yes, my lord. 
WIZARD: If even one of those bottles break, your debt to me would increase by VALUE pieces of gold.
MINION: I wouldn't dare damage the goods, I swear.
WIZARD: Good. Why don't we set up camp here? It'll be sundown soon.
MINION: Yes, my lord. (Put box down)
WIZARD: We should arrive in town tomorrow if we wake up early enough.
MINION: I shall start assembling the tents.
Meanwhile KNIGHT: (Enter stage left.)
WIZARD: Who goes there?!
KNIGHT: It is I, Sir TITLE. I was told a potion seller might be in these woods, and it appears I've finally found you.
MINION: But we're not... 
WIZARD: Hush, NAME! (whisper to companion) Perhaps we can turn a higher profit by sparing just one potion. 
MINION: Ohhhh... Okay!
KNIGHT: My dear potion seller, I am going into battle, and I want your strongest EFFECT potions.
MINION: I'm afraid these potions are too strong for you, Sir TITLE. 
WIZARD: And possibly too expensive! My strongest potions are reserved for those who can prove they can handle them with their, um, *cough* coin purse. *cough*
KNIGHT: Potion seller, I shall tell you again, I am going into battle, and I want only your strongest EFFECT potions. 
KNIGHT: I serve the His Majesty, Lord KING, and I'm sure he may pay you on my behalf.
WIZARD: You cannot handle my EFFECT potions. They are too strong for you.
KNIGHT: Potion seller, listen to me. I want only your strongest potion.
MINION: These potions would kill you, Sir TITLE. You cannot handle my lord's EFFECT potions.
KNIGHT: Enough of these games! I am going into battle, and I need your strongest potions. 
WIZARD: Unless you can provide VALUE pieces of gold right now, I'm afraid my strongest EFFECT potions would kill you, traveler.
WIZARD: You cannot handle my strongest potions if you do not have the gold.
MINION: You'd better go to a seller that sells weaker potions!
WIZARD: (hit your companion) Hush!
KNIGHT: Potion seller, I'm telling you right now; I am going into battle and I need your strongest potions. 
KNIGHT: Lord KING will surely pay you once the battle is won.
WIZARD: You do not know what you ask, traveler. My strongest EFFECT potions could kill a dragon, let alone a man. They are too strong for you.
KNIGHT: Potion seller, I am telling you I need your strongest potions. I'm going into battle, for gods sake!
KNIGHT: I'm going into battle, and I need your strongest EFFECT potions!
WIZARD: You cannot handle my strongest potions! 
MINION: No one can! 
WIZARD: My strongest potions are not fit for a beast, let alone a man!
KNIGHT: What must I say to get your EFFECT potions, potion seller? I do not have VALUE gold.
KNIGHT: Why won't you trust me with your strongest potions? I need them if I am to be successful in battle! 
WIZARD: I cannot give you my strongest potions because my strongest potions are only for the strongest beings.
WIZARD: And you are of the weakest beings I've seen, Sir TITLE!
MINION: You're weak because you have no gold!
KNIGHT: (sadly) Well... then thats it, potion seller! I'll go elsewhere. I'll go elsewhere for my potions.
WIZARD: That's what you better do.
KNIGHT: (crying) I'll go elsewhere for my EFFECT potions and I'll never come back!
MINION: Good! You're not welcome here!
WIZARD: My EFFECT potions are only for the strongest, and you are clearly not of the strongest men who have heavy bags of gold!
WIZARD: You are the weakest!
KNIGHT: You've had your say, potion seller, but I shall have mine. You are a rascal! A rascal with no respect for knights! 
KNIGHT: No respect for anything... except your EFFECT potions! (run off stage crying)
WIZARD: (to your companion) Why respect knights with no gold when you can sell these to some idiot for double the price in town?

DOG: I am too small to fight this lion, and there’s little chance he wouldn’t spot me in the next 5 minutes.

Meanwhile MONKEY: (Start climbing up the ladder backstage. Watch the scene below you, and do what the narrator says.)
NARRATOR: Taking one bone in his mouth, he yelled with all his might,
DOG: Wow, that lion was delicious! If only I got one more lion to eat, it would surely satisfy my hunger for the night.
NARRATOR: On hearing this, the lion traced back his steps. Surprised with what the dog had said, the lion thought to himself,
LION: This dog seems pretty brave. He hunted down a lion? Let's get out of here before he makes me his next meal! (Run away)

Meanwhile MONKEY: (Follow the lion back out on stage.)

DOG: This ADJ monkey, it’s been almost an hour since I sent him to get that lion. How difficult is it to convince one lion? ADDY fellow!

Pokemon: *Jumps out of cup* SNOM! *Runs around*
Detective Pikachu: AAHHH!!
(Silly music 2)
Pokemon: SNOM! SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: What the?! A SNOM!?
Tim: I found this LITTLE SNOM on the streets looking sad and worried, so I thought maybe we could help it out.
Detective Pikachu: So wait, No COFFEE?
Tim: ahh, well *Looks away*
Detective Pikachu: Did the SNOM drink all my COFFEE?! *Points to the Pokemon in anger*
Pokemon: *shakes head* SNOM SNOM SNOM!
Tim: No no, it's just when I was heading back to the office I bumped into someone and all the COFFEE fell into the MUD.
(Lacrimosa Music)
Detective Pikachu: Noooooo, I was looking forward to drinking that COFFEE.
Tim: Pikachu you have been drinking too much COFFEE these past few days, thats not right.
(Shark Tank positive music)
Detective Pikachu: Your right, sorry. No use crying over spilled COFFEE. 
Detective Pikachu: Besides, right now we have an SNOM in need.
Detective Pikachu: *Walks up to the Pokemon* So, what happened to you? 
Pokemon: SNOM SNOM SNOM, SNOM SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: *Nods* Mhm and then?
Pokemon: SNOM SNOM, SNOM SNOM!
Pokemon: *feeling sad* SNOM SNOM.
Tim: Uhh, What is it saying?
Detective Pikachu: *Looks at Tim* It seems like this LITTLE SNOM here lost its partner and doesn't know where to go.
Pokemon: SNOM!
Detective Pikachu: It was asleep till it woke up from a fall and was dazed for quite a bit.
Detective Pikachu: Then you came along and the rest is history.
Tim: Can it describe what its partner looks like, maybe I saw them while I was out.
Detective Pikachu: *Looks back at the Pokemon* Well, can you tell us about your partner?
Pokemon: SNOM SNOM.
Detective Pikachu: He was TALL, and had a big BEARD.
Pokemon: SNOM SNOM SNOM.
Detective Pikachu: and that lately he's been feeling tired and wanted to freshen up for a big interview. 
Tim: *Thinking* Hm, I think I did see someone TALL and BEARD
Tim: around the same time I bummed into someone when I was getting ready to head here.
Detective Pikachu: *Walks around a bit in circles thinking* Hmm
(Anime sword gleam 1)
Detective Pikachu: *Gasp*
Detective Pikachu: ) *Looks at the audience, Claps, and points up* A Bolt of Brilliance! I know where your partner is LITTLE SNOM.
(Noir music 3)
Tim: Really? Do you know where they are?
Detective Pikachu: I'm surprised you didn't pick up on it too Tim. 
Detective Pikachu: You went out to get me my large cup of COFFEE.
Detective Pikachu: And since my order of COFFEE was so large you've probably focused your attention more on not spilling the COFFEE than on your surroundings.
Detective Pikachu: Around the same time SNOM's TALL BEARD partner was too tired to see where they were walking and bumped into you.
Detective Pikachu: Not only spilling my delicious COFFEE but also knocking SNOM off of its partner in the process.
Tim: But if all that was true then where would SNOM's partner be?
Detective Pikachu: *walks towards the door* Where else do I go to get my fix to wake me up?
Detective Pikachu: At the CAFE SHOP!
Tim: This better not be an excuse to get more COFFEE
Detective Pikachu: Trust me, Tim. This Detective is never wrong.
Detective Pikachu: *leaves through the door*

Meanwhile BORED PLAYER: (Pretend to play games on your phone) Uh huh.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Cackle like a goblin) I THIRST FOR BLOOD.
DUNGEON MASTER: Very good. Last we left off, you were following a MYTHICAL CREATURE into an enchanted glade, when suddenly, you got lost!
NEWBIE PLAYER: I recall! Our MYTHICAL CREATURE guide suddenly disappeared, that rascal! I hope it returns soon.
BORED PLAYER: Huh? I don't remember that.
DUNGEON MASTER: Maybe because you spent the entire last session playing MOBILE GAME on your phone.
BORED PLAYER: (Shrug and play games on your phone) Not my fault MOBILE GAME is more entertaining than your dumb game.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: No! It's gone?! But I was going to pickpocket the MYTHICAL CREATURE and steal its TREASURE while it wasn't looking!
DUNGEON MASTER: I already told you, you can't do that. It's impossible.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: But I rolled a 20! Fine, can I steal its BODY PART when it comes back and sell it back in town?
DUNGEON MASTER: Also impossible. Besides, that would initiate combat. Are you sure you want to do that?
NEWBIE PLAYER: No, no! We're only level 1, and that MYTHICAL CREATURE is supposed to be our guide through these woods.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: And look where it's gotten us! We're lost! We should have killed it while it was WACKY ACTION.
BORED PLAYER: This sucks. I'm bored. I'm ordering a pizza. (Put your phone to your ear) Hi, Instant Pizza? I'd like to place an order.
DUNGEON MASTER: Hey! It's not that boring! Now look, you're lost in a magical wood. It's foggy and there's no signs of civilization. What do you do?

NEWBIE PLAYER: (Point to BORED PLAYER) You there, you're a ranger! Do you recognize these odd tracks? Do they belong to the MYTHICAL CREATURE that was guiding us?
BORED PLAYER: (Look up from your phone) Uh, how should I know?
DUNGEON MASTER: You can roll a Survival check, you INSULT.
BORED PLAYER: You're the INSULT, INSULT. (Roll some dice)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: I set the giant spider webs on fire then do a triple front flip somersault through them!
DUNGEON MASTER: Wait your turn, Rogue. Ranger, what was your roll?
Knocking on door
BORED PLAYER: Who cares? Pizza's here. (Walk to the door and open it)
PIZZA GUY: Hi, Instant Pizza! Hot, fresh, ADJECTIVE pizza delivered to your door instantaneously. Sorry I'm late. Here's your pizza with extra TOPPING!
BORED PLAYER: No prob, dude. Come put it on the table. (Walk back to the table)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Follow BORED PLAYER back to the table)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: I changed my mind. I push the wizard into the spider webs!
DUNGEON MASTER: Uhh, ok. Roll Athletics.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Roll some dice) 13! Did I do it? Is the wizard going to be eaten!? (Point at NEWBIE PLAYER) I hope they lay eggs in you! Mwahaha!
NEWBIE PLAYER: You greatly disturb me, Rogue. Dungeon master, can't I dodge or something?
PIZZA GUY: Oh cool, you guys are playing D&D? I'm a dungeon master myself. (Set the pizza down)
DUNGEON MASTER: (Point at Pizza Guy) Yes, and you're very rudely interrupting our game! 
DUNGEON MASTER: Alright Wizard, the Rogue pushes you into the spider webs. Four giant Phase Spiders suddenly appear around you, gnashing their teeth hungrily.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: Yes! Feast upon his squishy magic BODY PART! Mwahaha!
NEWBIE PLAYER: What's with you and your obsession with BODY PARTs?
PIZZA GUY: Wait, doesn't the wizard get to contest the roll?
DUNGEON MASTER: Huh? Contest the roll?
PIZZA GUY: Well that was a shove. According to page 195 of the Player's Handbook, the wizard gets to roll Athletics or Acrobatics to contest the rogue's check.
NEWBIE PLAYER: I do?
DUNGEON MASTER: They do? I mean, yes of course. I knew that! I was just getting to that before you interrupted me.
DUNGEON MASTER: Fine, you can roll, but don't use those metal dice again, or-
Meanwhile NEWBIE PLAYER: (Roll some dice)
Crashing debris
NEWBIE PLAYER: 14. Do I win?
DUNGEON MASTER: (Tired) No, the spider webs are too sticky and- (look at Pizza Guy as you're talked over)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Loud) Yeah! 14 is higher than 13, so the Rogue fails to push you. Congrats, you're not stuck in the spider webs!
DUNGEON MASTER: Excuse me, but this is my table. You can't just come in here and decide what happens! Make your own game if you want to be the DM.
NEWBIE PLAYER: I don't know, I kind of like the new guy. He kept me from getting eaten by spiders.
BORED PLAYER: He brought us pizza too, so I like him.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: He foiled my plans, but... Hey, pizza guy! You know stuff about this game! Tell me, is it really impossible to steal a BODY PART from a MYTHICAL CREATURE?
PIZZA GUY: Well sure it's possible. There's rules for harvesting body parts, crafting them into magic items, stuff like that. It's all in the books.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You liar! How dare you deprive me of MYTHICAL CREATURE BODY PART?
NEWBIE PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You would've let me die if the pizza guy didn't correct you! I cast SPELL on you!
BORED PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You keep distracting me from grinding in MOBILE GAME with dice rolls and silly voices.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Look at NEWBIE PLAYER.) Mutiny? (Quick nod. Grab DUNGEON MASTER and drag him out the door)
Meanwhile NEWBIE PLAYER: (Look at CHAOTIC PLAYER.) Mutiny? (Quick nod. Grab DUNGEON MASTER and drag him out the door)

Brain: I must perform the surgery myself *puts on disguise*

TYPEWRITER: August 14th; 1972
MAIN DETECTIVE: (take a puff out of cigarette in hand) Man, this new case has me in quite a pickle.
MAIN DETECTIVE: (point towards crime board) For the past 3 months, I have been tracking down this one person, goes by the name VNO, head of a major crime ring.
MAIN DETECTIVE: That rings name goes by CRN, yeah I know, shocker.
MAIN DETECTIVE: But they do hide their deals well through CRN.
MAIN DETECTIVE: They mainly deal substances around the same tune as SBS which has killed many people due to its sheer addictiveness.
MAIN DETECTIVE: (go back to chair) But, no matter what pieces of evidence I find I always seem like I'm going in circles.
MAIN DETECTIVE: I mean there combined inventory of SBS Is probably around the tune of like MSC dollars and somehow we cant trace any amount of that size towards any leads.
MAIN DETECTIVE: I just think I need a rest, Its been a long day. I'm just gonna rest on my chair for a while.
MAIN DETECTIVE: I deserve this rest. I can just feel it, either tomorrow, or this month I know I'm gonna bust this whole thing down.
MAIN DETECTIVE: (go to sleep in chair)

UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: (walk towards audience) Look either it be like, two or three weeks ago I got a case on my desk talking about the case of COT, and I just made a huge discovery
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: You see, If you guys have been paying attention for the last couple of meetings I got really close to one of the most infamous crime bosses in the city, VNA!
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: But my time was cut out by a shoot out I had in the street of HLL.
MAIN DETECTIVE: (start to wake up and interrupt) he-Hey! BCS! What are you doing in my house!
Meanwhile UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: You see, I was just marching towards this big building on HLL...
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: Ok I'm sorry, Your office? Because last time I checked I pay rent for this building.
MAIN DETECTIVE: Buddy this better be a joke and you came in here with a reason.
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: Well there's no way we can both pay rent on this building.
MAIN DETECTIVE: Oh, I pay for much more than this rent, as I also have a GUN hidden somewhere in this room and you don't know, I hope.
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: You don't carry your GUN on you? Rookie mistake.

MAIN DETECTIVE: I SLEEP HERE! I have slept here through out a MSC nights how have I not seen any of you!
JUSTIFIABLY MAD DETECTIVE: Well you two clearly are not detectives, as real ones go across the globe, and don't just stay in their house all day.
JUSTIFIABLY MAD DETECTIVE: In fact, What you are in currently is my house.
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: There is no way we can all pay rent at the same time.

MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: SO YOU THINK! While you two thought you were on a simple manhunt for SBS, or the case of COT,
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: or even the names you hold close, like VNO, or VNA! Both delusions from keeping you from what your eyes truly have never seen!
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: Tis it is I! Not any commoner villain living in HLL, but as the global villain known as VVV!
MAIN DETECTIVE: (wait for like two seconds) wow that name sucks.
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: Hey, shut up man I'm doing my best!
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: I would have thought that was a character from a kids cartoon.
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: Enough of this, I will not take insults from commoner folk like you!
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: You should be groveling at my feet like dogs! Behold, your new master VVV as they control everything about you!

JUSTIFIABLY MAD DETECTIVE: Thank god, I had been searching for VVV for months, thank god that's over.
MAIN DETECTIVE: Wait, if he led us here, then how did we just assume that this was our house.
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: (while still on ground) I put poison in the waterplay to make you think this was your house
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: Why didn't you just poison the water with SBS, like that could have killed us and you just chose not too.
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: (get off ground) Hey I didn't ask for your opinion! Its not like I see you being a villain!
JUSTIFIABLY MAD DETECTIVE: Could you just leave already, you are the worst dead person I think I have ever witnessed
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: aw man (walk of stage really sadly)
JUSTIFIABLY MAD DETECTIVE: Welp, all's well, that ends well!

OTHER GUEST: (Wave) Hewwo
MASTERMIND: (Whispering to BODYGUARD) GRONK, who is this other guest?

AGENT: (Suspicious) I'm fine, really. Actually, I've been meaning to ask you some... questions.
MASTERMIND: I'll give you all the information you need if you just... eat the DESSERT...
AGENT: Wait a second. Something's wrong here.
AGENT: (Whispering into secret device) HQ, I think the location is compromised. Attempting to exfiltrate.
MASTERMIND: What's that? "Exfiltrate?" You will do no such thing!
MASTERMIND: GRONK, retrain our guest!
Tense cinematic music
BODYGUARD: (Grunt) (Get behind the AGENT and hold them in their chair)
AGENT: (Struggle to get free from your chair) What matter of evil is this, Doctor EVIL?
MASTERMIND: I know your true identity, PRICE WELLINGTON! Or should I say... Agent MOCKINGBIRD!
AGENT: How did you know? My disguise was IMPENETRABLE!
MASTERMIND: I have eyes and ears and SPLEENs everywhere, agent MOCKINGBIRD!
MASTERMIND: And after I destroy you, nothing will stand in the way of my master plan--
MASTERMIND: To release CHEMICAL into the water supply!
MASTERMIND: I will turn everyone into HAPPY SNAKEs! And nobody will be able to stop me!
AGENT: You're a corrupted criminal, Doctor EVIL!
AGENT: You'll never succeed!
MASTERMIND: You will be my first test subject, Agent MOCKINGBIRD.
MASTERMIND: You WILL eat the DESSERT laced with CHEMICAL.
BODYGUARD: (Force-feed the AGENT DESSERT) You eat DESSERT and become SNAKE now.
Meanwhile AGENT: Nooo! (You are force-fed DESSERT)
MASTERMIND: (Evil laughter) Soon everyone will be HAPPY! And everyone will be a SNAKE!

OTHER GUEST: It's me, Agent MOCKINGBIRD. The REAL Agent MOCKINGBIRD.
MASTERMIND: (Confused) What? Then who's this guy? (Point at AGENTin chair)
OTHER GUEST: That's just a decoy. A random person I found on the street.
AGENT: Agent MOCKINGBIRD said if I just acted really suspicious and distracted you, I would get NICE THING.
OTHER GUEST: I give them a suit and a radio communicator-- and you fell for it! Because you're evil! And stupid!
OTHER GUEST: It's over, Doctor EVIL!

JAMIE: Let's brace ourselves for what's to come!
CHEF1: (Confidently) I've crafted a dish that even the chefs of COUNTRY would envy!
CHEF2: (Fidgeting) And I... well, I tried to do something... inspired by CELEBRITY.
JAMIE: Charlie, your dish looks... um, explosive?
CHEF1: That's the spirit of a DISH! I added extra BOMB for a real bang!

CHEF2: (Grinning) Sometimes the best surprises are the ones you can't see!
JAMIE: (To audience) That concludes today's episode of "The Bakeoff".
JAMIE: Todays lesson: Culinary surprises are great, as long as they don't require a fire extinguisher!
Gameshow outro
CHEF1: (Muttering) Next time, less sparkle, more FLAVOR flavor...
CHEF2: (Happily) And maybe I should start trusting my secret twists more!

Noir Music 3 
MISS SCARLETT: (Looking around) Well, the air certainly is Charged tonight, isn't it? There's nothing like a good storm to set the mood for unraveling a mystery. 
PROFESSOR PLUM: Indeed, Detective. The Unseasonable demise of our dear Mr. NOUN9 leaves us with many questions.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Most pressing: who among us is the perpetrator of this vile deed?
MRS. PEACOCK: (fan yourself with a clue card) It's all quite unbearable to think that one of us could be capable of murder. I feel like I could faint at the very notion! 
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Pound your fist on the table) Enough of this dilly-dallying! I say we get to the bottom of this. 
COLONEL MUSTARD: Someone here is the murderer.
COLONEL MUSTARD: And I won't rest until we've sniffed 'em out!
MISS SCARLETT: I agree, Colonel. Let us begin our inquiry. Please, everyone, take a moment to recall your Whereabouts at the time of Mr. NOUN9's unfortunate... accident.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Well, I was in the NOUN1—entirely engrossed in a fascinating volume about NOUN2. The time simply slipped away from me.
MISS SCARLETT: You'll have to enlighten me about this NOUN2 after our mystery, Mr. Plum.
MRS. PEACOCK: And I was having a delightful conversation in the NOUN3. The orchids there are just divine this time of year.
COLONEL MUSTARD: I was in the NOUN4, engaging in a bit of solitary practice. No one can accuse me of cheating when I was alone the whole time!
MISS SCARLETT: Yes, well, we shall see if your alibis hold up. Now let's examine the available evidence. Where exactly was Mr. NOUN9 found?
PROFESSOR PLUM: His body was in the NOUN5, right on the floor. Poor chap.
MISS SCARLETT: And the murder weapon?
MRS. PEACOCK: (Gasping) Oh, it was something dreadful—a NOUN6, if you can believe it! Such a lovely piece, turned into an instrument of death.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Inspecting the cards) And what of the fingerprint analysis and the footprints? We can't overlook any detail, no matter how small.
MISS SCARLETT: Precisely, Colonel. Now, we all had access to a NOUN6, and it could easily have been transported to the NOUN5.
MISS SCARLETT:  We must scrutinize our evidence and interrogate one another until cracks in our stories are revealed.
TYPEWRITER: After lots of discoveries later
Shark Tank serious music 1
MISS SCARLETT: (Holding up a notepad) Now, let's recount our discoveries. Colonel Mustard, you claim to have been in the NOUN4. 
MISS SCARLETT: But a torn matchbook from the lounge was found in your Jacket. Care to explain?
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Stammering) Well, yes, I... I might have stopped by the NOUN1. But for a harmless drink! It means nothing, I assure you.
PROFESSOR PLUM: (Intrigued) A drink, you say? Or perhaps to pick up a handy NOUN6?
MRS. PEACOCK: But let's not forget the NOUN8 found beside the flowerpot in the conservatory.
MRS. PEACOCK: This means somebody could have used to stroll through the secret passage to the NOUN3.
MISS SCARLETT: (Eyeing Mrs. Peacock) A valid point. The secret passages aren't common knowledge, Mrs. Peacock. Your familiarity is... curious.
MRS. PEACOCK: (Whispering to themself) This is not how it was supposed to...
MISS SCARLETT: (Overhearing) Something you’d like to share with the group, Mrs. Peacock?
PROFESSOR PLUM: And let's not overlook the NOUN7 found in NOUN3—a perfect tool for a... scholarly type to utilize in a violent manner.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Nodding) Ah, Professor, were you not alone with your precious books around the time of the... incident?
MISS SCARLETT: (Tapping the notepad) We've had our share of bluffs and deflections. It's time we cut through the noise. 
MISS SCARLETT: The NOUN7 was also found dusted with ash—suggesting it was recently near the fireplace here in this very room.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Pointedly) Well then, Detective, it seems you're the only one without a suspect item tied to 'em. How do we know it wasn't you?
MISS SCARLETT: (Smiling slightly) Because, dear Colonel, unlike our hidden assailant, I do not stand to gain from Mr. NOUN9's untimely demise. 
MISS SCARLETT: And my fingerprints were not found on the murder weapon.
MISS SCARLETT: The NOUN8, the NOUN7, the scattered pages from Mr. NOUN9's diary—all of these paint a damning picture. It is time for the culprits to reveal themselves.
MISS SCARLETT: (Slowly) And that person is...
MISS SCARLETT: (With finality) Mrs. Peacock!
Thunder
Noir music 4
MRS. PEACOCK: (Shocked) Me? Oh, Detective, surely you jest! How could you possibly think that I, a lady of my standing, could commit such a heinous act?
MISS SCARLETT: (Raising an eyebrow) The clues do not lie, Mrs. Peacock. Yes, everyone had access to a NOUN6, but not everyone had a motive.
MISS SCARLETT: The torn page from the guestbook found near the body contained a cryptic message in your handwriting.
MISS SCARLETT: And the orchid you so admire—its specific pollen was found on Mr. NOUN9's cuff.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Quite the deduction, Detective. It's always the details that give the game away.
COLONEL MUSTARD: And what about the footprints leading to the NOUN3? A distinctive tread pattern that matches none other than Mrs. Peacock's heels!
MRS. PEACOCK: This is preposterous! I've been framed! I would never soil my hands with such... such...
MISS SCARLETT: ...guilt? I do believe you protested a tad too much throughout our investigation. 
MISS SCARLETT: The truth always emerges, Mrs. Peacock. As they say, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Nodding with satisfaction) Splendid work, Detective. Justice will be served tonight.
MRS. PEACOCK: It... It was the money, you see. Mr. NOUN9 threatened to cut me off, to reveal my little... indiscretions. I couldn't allow that.
MISS SCARLETT: (Sympathetically) A tragic end to a desperate measure.
Knocking on door
POLICEMAN: Detective Scarlet, we received your call. Is this the suspect?
MISS SCARLETT: (Nods) Yes, officer. Take her into custody.
POLICEMAN: (Handcuffs Mrs. Peacock) Put your hands behind your back, Mrs. Peacock, you're going away for a long time.
Meanwhile MRS. PEACOCK: (Puts her hands behind her back as she gets cuffed)
POLICEMAN: (Walks out of the room with Mrs. Peacock)
Meanwhile MRS. PEACOCK: (Walks out of the room with the policeman) Let me go! These are just filthy liars!
MISS SCARLETT: Another case closed, thanks to deduction and attention to detail. Although, let's hope our next gathering is under less... murderous circumstances.

Confident Person: And you don’t get worried that some weirdo would come around and…I dunno… VERB you?
Waterphone
Nervous Person: VERB me? (Laugh nervously) No, why would anyone do that? This is CITY, the safest place on earth to live!
Confident Person: You’re right, there’s no way anything bad could happen to you, in CITY, in the middle of nowhere, on a Sunday of all days!

Delivery Guy: That’ll come to…uh… PRICE
Nervous Person: Holy crap! You delivery drivers sure make a VERBing with this gig huh? Keep the change.
Delivery Guy: You can blame RESTAURANT for that…oh, I see you have a date going on. Back when I was younger, I used to be quite the VERBer myself. 
Delivery Guy:  In fact, I heard there was a Serial VERBer on the run tonight...

Confident Person: NO WAY, oh my gosh, is this your first time too? I can’t believe I ruined your first time VERBing someone!
Nervous Person: It’s ok…man, I don’t know why I was so nervous about all this, maybe because it was my first time using DATING APP? 
Nervous Person: I guess I can say that I found my soulmate on the first try! Haha
Laughter
Confident Person: Dude, you have got to learn to chill when it comes to VERBing! The first time is always tough but I swear it gets easier afterwards.
Nervous Person: You’re right. You’re absolutely right.

Confident Person: Ah, man, now I don’t wanna VERB you anymore, you seem cool…listen, how about we chat over this food you got from RESTAURANT, hm?

MODERATOR: Welcome to debate number NUMBER of the next United States presidential election! 
applause
MODERATOR: This year’s candidates are still running neck-and-neck in the polls, so this is their last chance to make their case.
MODERATOR: So, let’s get right to it. First, please join me in extending a warm welcome to our first candidate, Senator NAME 1!
applause
CANDIDATE 1: Thank you! Thank you all.
MODERATOR: And on the opposite side of the political spectrum, let’s give it up for our second candidate, Governor NAME 2!
applause
CANDIDATE 2: Good evening, everyone! Thank you for voting for me!
laughter
MODERATOR: Now let’s not get ahead of ourselves, but let’s get right to it.
MODERATOR: Senator NAME 1, do you support POLITICAL ISSUE?
CANDIDATE 1: Well, I have friends who support POLITICAL ISSUE, and I have friends who oppose POLITICAL ISSUE.
CANDIDATE 1: And if you want to know where I stand – I stand with my friends!
MODERATOR: So, you’re basically a pro-friends candidate.
CANDIDATE 1: That’s right.
applause
MODERATOR: Okay then. Governor NAME 2. Do you support war or peace?
CANDIDATE 2: Well, that depends on what you mean. 
CANDIDATE 2: Like, what do you really mean when you say “war”? And, are you talking about “peace peace,” or just about “PEACEFUL THING”?
MODERATOR: You may define the terms however you like.
CANDIDATE 2: So, there’s the question. War or peace? Peace or war? What really matters is what you stand for.
MODERATOR: “What really matters is what you stand for.” Profound indeed. May we quote you on that?
CANDIDATE 2: Absolutely.
applause
MODERATOR: Great. Okay. So now let’s get down to the things that really set you apart. Senator NAME 1 – FOOD 1 or FOOD 2?
CANDIDATE 1: FOOD 1.
MODERATOR: And Senator NAME 2, same question for you. FOOD 1 or FOOD 2?
CANDIDATE 2: FOOD 2. Definitely.
MODERATOR: So, there you have it, folks. A clear distinction. Now for the twist – what about voters who don’t like either FOOD 1 or FOOD 2, but like FOOD 3 instead?
CANDIDATE 1: That's what third parties are for.
CANDIDATE 2: I agree. Let those people vote for somebody else.
MODERATOR: Wow – bipartisan agreement. What a tough choice this election year is going to be!
applause
MODERATOR: Okay, the next question is to Senator NAME 1. What would you sell your soul for?
CANDIDATE 1: Um, I'm afraid that ship's already sailed.
MODERATOR: Excuse me?
CANDIDATE 1: Yeah, sorry, I have nothing left to sell.
MODERATOR: Well then. Governor NAME 2, what about you? What would you sell your soul for?
CANDIDATE 2: Actually, I've already taken out one primary mortgage on my soul, and I've already taken out two soul equity loans, so there's that. 
MODERATOR: So basically, you're an all-in candidate. In for a penny, in for a pound, is that right?
CANDIDATE 2: Yes, that's right. Once I set my mind to something, I'll do anything to get it done.
applause
MODERATOR: Very good, both of you. So, let’s get to closing statements. Senator NAME 1, why should the American people vote for you?
CANDIDATE 1: My fellow Americans, for too long, FOOD 2 has dominated the culinary landscape. 
CANDIDATE 1: Don’t you think it’s high time that FOOD 1 is mandated to be offered by every restaurant and cafeteria in our country?
CANDIDATE 1: A vote for NAME 1 is a vote for FOOD 1.
MODERATOR: Very persuasive. Governor NAME 2, your turn. Why should the American people vote for you instead?
CANDIDATE 2: I can think of one very good reason.
CANDIDATE 2: Because VERY GOOD REASON.

sad chug jug music
DOCTOR: So NAME2 , have the medications i prescribed you last time been giving you any side effects?
SICK KID: (hopelessly) Sadly, yeah Dr. NAME1 . I have been experiencing MED1 , not to mention the MED2 .
DOCTOR: (writing on a clipboard) okay, the MED1 might be a little bit concerning, I'm going to look into that in just a moment.
DOCTOR: But as we have previously talked about, MED2 is absolutely normal under... those circumstances.
SICK KID: (Depressed) I guess so...
DOCTOR: (Leaning in and talking softly) Listen NAME2 , I'm so sorry that you have to go through this. I wish i could change the way things are.
SICK KID: (Looking up at Dr.) It's alright Dr. NAME1 . Ever since I've gotten diagnosed with ILLNESS I've just been hoping to make the most out of the time i have left.
SICK KID: And I'm not in a rush to die! Hahah- (heavy coughing)
Meanwhile DOCTOR: (Rub Kid's back)
DOCTOR: Slow breaths NAME2 , slow breaths.
DOCTOR: You're a fighter, NAME2 . (dramatic effect pause) Alright well, let me take a look at that MED1 you were talking about.
DOCTOR: (Inspect kid) Alright let's see...
Music Stops
extreme knocking
KAREN: (From outside the door) Hello? Anyone in here? It's my turn now.
DOCTOR: This room is occupied!
break down door
Meanwhile KAREN: (break down door) Screw this, i don't have time for any of this.
double bass music
DOCTOR: Excuse me miss, I'm treating a patient in here. And you can't just break down the door, you might even have to pay for potential damages.
Meanwhile RECEPTIONIST: (Follow after Karen)
RECEPTIONIST: I'm so sorry Dr. NAME1 i tried to stop her but she just wouldn't listen to anything i-
KAREN: (Sassy) Now you listen to me, Dr. Weirdface. I have been sitting in this filthy waiting room for 15 minutes already.
KAREN: And frankly, that's 15 minutes too long. I could have caught a SICKNESS1 , or worse, SICKNESS2 .
DOCTOR: (Matching Karen's Energy) Well "excuse" me, lady. I don't seem to have caught your name earlier.
KAREN: (Passive aggressive, high pitched voice) Karen. Karen NAME3 . You should've known that, seeing that i have an appointment right now.
DOCTOR: (To Receptionist) Miss Honey, when exactly did "Karen NAME3 " arrive at the facility today?
RECEPTIONIST: (shaken up) Uhm, certainly Dr. NAME1 , let me check that really quickly. (Looking through data on a clipboard)
RECEPTIONIST: Alright so Mrs. NAME3 arrived at reception at 3:19 pm today.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Honey. (Turn to Karen) Now if i remember correctly, your appointment was at 2:45 pm.
KAREN: It's not my fault i was late, it's the baby's. Dumb thing puked all over my ITEM and I had to go to the store to get something to clean it.
KAREN: And in the store a ROADB blocked the Isle so i couldn't get to where i needed to go.
SICK KID: You're taking care of a baby? Maybe being an orphan isn't so bad after all. Speaking of, where's your Baby at?
KAREN: Excuse you? Who's this eight year old talking to me right now?
DOCTOR: This is NAME2, my Patient that i am trying to treat.
KAREN: Well tell NAME2 that Karen NAME3 has an appointment and is here now.
DOCTOR: Ma'am, that's not how we operate. You're gonna have to wait your turn. Well, you would have had to wait.
DOCTOR: But instead, you're making a huge scene. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the property.
KAREN: (Laughing) Yeah, no. That's not gonna happen. I want to speak to your manager.
vine boom
DOCTOR: Ma'am... I am the Manager.
Music stops
groose music
DOCTOR: See? I don't even get a vine boom sound effect because it's so obvious. Do you not know how doctor's offices work?
KAREN: This is absolutely unacceptable! I'm being actively disrespected.
SICK KID: It's okay Dr. NAME1 , she can go first. Anything to make her leave. My head really hurts.
KAREN: Even this eight year old knows how to treat a lady better than you, Doctor. Besides, what could he have that is more important that my INFECTION ?
DOCTOR: NAME2 has ILLNESS , a terminal illness that will kill him in approximately the next 20 days.
SICK KID: (Shocked) WHAT? You said 15 months at our last appointment! (Freak out and start crying and coughing)
DOCTOR: I did, but that was before you told me about the MED1 .
SICK KID: You said MED1 was "just a little bit concerning"!
KAREN: Sounds like there's not much you can do to help him anymore. So can you concentrate on my INFECTION now?
RECEPTIONIST: (Shy) Ahem, i don't mean to disrupt your conversation.
RECEPTIONIST: But are we really going to ignore the fact that Miss NAME3 is supposed to be taking care of an infant right now?
music stops
BABY: (from off stage) Karen?
lacrimosa music
BABY: (Enter) There you are Karen.
BABY: (Get close to Karen) Now you listen here. Do you have any idea what it takes for a baby to break out of a locked car in the burning sun of midsummer?
BABY: I had to hot wire the car wrongly so i could open up the car doors without a key while being both dehydrated and having slippy fingers from excessive sweat.
BABY: AND WHILE BEING A BABY.
KAREN: Well speak of the god damn devil...
SICK KID: (Panicked) Am I dead or is anyone else seeing a baby with a grown man's voice right now?
RECEPTIONIST: Karen, what... is... your baby?
KAREN: Ugh, it's not "my" Baby. It's BABYMOMMA 's Kid. They just want me to take care of it cuz i owe them.
double bass music
DOCTOR: Amazing. Ive never seen anything like this before. But what is it indeed?
BABY: So basically, I'm a Baby... that talks. That's basically the whole thought behind it. Joey was high as hell when she wrote this script.
DOCTOR: Fascinating.
BABY: It's really not.
BABY: I want to go home. (Turn to Karen) Karen, Did you get your INFECTION sorted out?
