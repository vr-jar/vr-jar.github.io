WOMAN: (Stick head in through door) Your POODLE is in my bedroom!
WOMAN: Come get your out of control dog for crying out loud!
WOMAN: (Sneeze) Achoo! (Leave)
TRAINER: Meh, he'll be fine. My POODLE is very graceful.
OWNER: I can't look at another CUPCAKE without thinking of my husband Dave.
(70s music)
OWNER: (Looking at TRAINER flirtatiously) But you're not a CUPCAKE...
TRAINER: Are you saying you like to look at me?
OWNER: Do you work out?
TRAINER: I walk my dog while doing STRENUOUS ACTIVITY.

(Music stops)
CAT: (Lonely meow) Mow
WOMAN: Aww, poor kitty. Your name was MITTENS, right? (Offering the cat a snack) Do you want some SNACK?
CAT: Mow (Pee on the floor)
Meanwhile WOMAN: (Reacting to CAT peeing on carpet) No! Not the clean floor! Bad kitty! Bad MITTENS! Shoo!
WOMAN: (Reacting to CAT peeing on carpet) No! Not the clean floor! Bad kitty! Bad MITTENS! Shoo!

MODERATOR: Interesting points on both sides. However, we are almost out of time.
MODERATOR: Mr. Cletus Williams, do you have any closing remarks?
USA Anthem Music
COWBOY: Well folks, the choice is clear. A vote for me is a vote for good old-fashioned American values, like cows, and CAPITALISM.
COWBOY: I stand for guns, freedom, guns, CAPITALISM, and not getting our BODY PARTS eaten by extraterrestrial forces.
COWBOY: However, I do concede that the love between brother and sister is strong.
COWBOY: But the love between a man and his GUN is stronger.
COWBOY: Your honor, I rest my case.
Music stops
Applause
MODERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Williams. XN-74, your closing remarks?
USA Anthem Music
ALIEN: Our ultimate goal is not destruction, but construction.
ALIEN: From the plasma-scorched ashes of this miserable sphere of rock you call "Earth", we will rebuild a new society,
ALIEN: Built on the slave labor of humans, and fueled by INTERNAL ORGAN burgers...
ALIEN: which is what we call cow hamburgers made from the INTERNAL ORGAN of humans.
ALIEN: I mean cows! I meant to say the INTERNAL ORGAN of cows.
ALIEN: They are extremely delicious and will be given to all the "Good" humans who work hard and don't incite an uprising against ZORTRON.
ALIEN: The "bad" humans will be put to work in the burger factory.

DETECTIVE: (Looking out the window) It's late one November night.
DETECTIVE: (Walk up to audience) The cigarette smoke swirls around my apartment like the puzzles swim around my mind.
DETECTIVE: I'm knee-deep in a labyrinth of dead ends and unanswered questions.
DETECTIVE: Who exactly was the Big Apple Burglar?
DETECTIVE: Why do they steal priceless jewels and leave little notes behind?
DETECTIVE: I had a hunch that the burglar was actually a SNAKE wearing a burglar costume, but... that trail went cold.
DETECTIVE: Imagine that. A SNAKE wearing a cute little burglar costume.
DETECTIVE: (Smoke cigarette, gag, cough) Makes me sick to my stomach.
Knocking on door
DETECTIVE: (Calling out) Who's there?
PIZZA GUY: Pizza delivery.
DETECTIVE: Come on... the door's open.
PIZZA GUY: (Enter) Here's your personal pan pizza, sir. Extra TOPPING.
Noir music 2
DETECTIVE: (Step forward and speak to audience again) He walked into my office wearing a goofy Pizza delivery outfit.
DETECTIVE: And LEGS like CHOPSTICKS that went... ALL the way up.
DETECTIVE: They say crime is like a big, juicy pizza, overflowing with TOPPING.
DETECTIVE: Except instead of pizza, it's New York City.
DETECTIVE: And instead of TOPPING, it's crime.
DETECTIVE: And the cheese? That's the RATS.
DETECTIVE: But something was off about this personal pan pizza with extra TOPPING... I could feel it.
DETECTIVE: (Return to scene, talk to PIZZA GUY) How much do I owe you?
PIZZA GUY: That will be 15 dollars.
DETECTIVE: (Taking money out of wallet) Here, kid. Keep the change.
PIZZA GUY: Thanks, have a nice day (Begin to move toward the door)
PIZZA GUY: (Remembering something) Say, detective... you wouldn't happen to have any JEWELS laying around the office, would you?
DETECTIVE: JEWELS? Kid, don't get me started on JEWELS. (Bite into a slice of pizza)
DETECTIVE: (Talk with mouth full) I'm hot on the case of the Big Apply Burglar, and all that dastardly thief does is steal JEWELS.
DETECTIVE: Except the trail's gone cold... (Spit out the pizza) Just like this pizza.
DETECTIVE: Say, why'd it take so long for you to get here? This pizza is stone cold like MY MOTHER.
PIZZA GUY: Sorry, detective. I had to take a quick, uh, "detour" on the way over.
PIZZA GUY: ... at the gun store. (Take out a gun and point it at the detective)
Vine boom
Noir music 3
DETECTIVE: (Gasp) You. You're the Big Apple Burglar!
PIZZA GUY: Finally figured it out, eh, detective?
DETECTIVE: (Step forward and speak to audience again) It all made sense now.
DETECTIVE: The pizza boxes we found at the crime scene. The TOPPING on the victim's bodies.
DETECTIVE: It was right under my nose the entire time.
DETECTIVE: But I wasn't about to let this ADJECTIVE-NOSE little creep get away this time...
DETECTIVE: and besides... I had something the thief wanted that was more valuable than priceless JEWELS.
PIZZA GUY: (To DETECTIVE) You should have put assembled all the slices of this mystery sooner, detective.
PIZZA GUY: Now, I'm the one who's going to leave YOU a fat tip...
PIZZA GUY: The tip of my bullet in your chest.
DETECTIVE: Oh, but Pizza guy... or should I say, "Big Apple Burglar"... I have some information that will interest you very much.
PIZZA GUY: Oh yeah? Nice try. Stop stalling for time.
PIZZA GUY: I'm going to silence you like I silence the notifications on my phone when my wife tries to call me about IMPORTANT BUSINESS.
PIZZA GUY: Besides, the only thing I care about is stealing all of the JEWELS in this city...
DETECTIVE: ... so that you can buy your SNAKE back from the crime boss, Big KAHUNA Frankie?
Noir music 2
PIZZA GUY: (Lowering gun) H-how do you know about that?
PIZZA GUY: How do you kn ow that Big KAHUNA Frankie, New York City's seventh-biggest crime boss, is holding my SNAKE hostage?
DETECTIVE: (Smoking) It wasn't easy to find that out, even for a detective like me.
DETECTIVE: I had to BRIBE a lot of guys.
DETECTIVE: What can I say... if you follow the trail of pizza, and BRIBE enough guys... that's classic detective work.
DETECTIVE: I may not agree with your methods, and I don't like your ADJECTIVE NOSE, but it seems like I don't have a much of a choice, now, do I?
PIZZA GUY: Listen, man. If you help me get my SNAKE back from Big KAHUNA Frankie, I'll return all the JEWELS. I swear it.
PIZZA GUY: I don't even like JEWELS. I just like pizza.... and murder.
DETECTIVE: Seems like you and me have more alike than I thought.
DETECTIVE: (Taking hat and coat from rack) Let's hit the road. If the cops ask any questions... I'll BRIBE them. (Leave)

World news intro
MODERATOR: Good evening and welcome to tonight's much-anticipated political debate.
MODERATOR: Tonight we are joined by our two presidential candidates.
MODERATOR: Representing the Gamer party, XXSHADOWNINJAXX.
Applause
GAMER: (Wave to audience) What's boppin, chat?
MODERATOR: And running independently, billionaire owner of the HoneyBear incorporated and the HoneyBear chocolate factory, John Bear.
Applause
JOHN: (Wave to audience) Ladies and gentlemen, is it my sweet, sweet pleasure to be here... or should I say, "BEE" here!
JOHN: Get it? Because I own a Honey company? (Laugh maniacally)
JOHN: Actually, HoneyBear Incorporated makes many candy products other than Honey. But that's neither here nor there--
JOHN: (Grandly) Let the tournament commence!
MODERATOR: Excuse me, sir.
MODERATOR: You may be the owner of the largest mega-corporation in the world,
MODERATOR: Which brings billions of pounds of delicious HONEY (and other candy products) to the children of the world,
MODERATOR: But in this debate room-- it is I, who am God.
JOHN: Tut tut, mister moderator! Don't forget who owns you... and your HOME!
MODERATOR: (Slightly scared) That might be so, but this is supposed to be a neutral setting for debate... and I am here to oversee it...
Meanwhile JOHN: (Mockingly imitate the MODERATOR's words)
JOHN: I OWN YOU!
Meanwhile MODERATOR: (Get scared) Ahh!
MODERATOR: (Scared, shaking) Um, y-yes, sorry, your candy-excellency.
MODERATOR: (Clearing throat) Ahem... Anyway... um...
JOHN: (Reminding) "Our first question is about candy..."
MODERATOR: Yes, yes, our first question is about candy.
MODERATOR: (Whispering to JOHN) Should I start with you, my lord?
JOHN: (Whispering to MODERATOR) No, it's fine, let "them" go first.
JOHN: (Whispering to MODERATOR) Then I will CRUSH them like a piece of hard candy beneath my feet.
MODERATOR: (To GAMER) XXSHADOWNINJAXX, what is your opinion on candy?
MODERATOR: Specifically, will you allow John Bear to distribute free candy to all the children of the nation?
USA anthem music
GAMER: (To audience) People of the United States of America... we have suffered too long at the hands of my opponent, John Bear, and his reign of corporate tyranny.
GAMER: Yes, he may be distributing free candy laced with ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE to the children of the world.
GAMER: But is all that ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE really free?
GAMER: If we were truly "free", we would be able to get our ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE from any ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE dealer we want.
GAMER: But I ask you, where are all the ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE dealers?
GAMER: What happened to them? One day, they were all just mysteriously... gone?
GAMER: If you ask me, that's a little sus.
GAMER: Now, I might just be an ordinary FORTNITE gamer. With the gamer tag XXSHADOWNINJAXX.
GAMER: But tonight, my cause is greater than any Victory Royale.
Gameshow buzzer
JOHN: Objection! Shut it down. FORTNITE was not on the approved list of topics for tonight's debate.
JOHN: Why not change the subject and talk about my newest line of LOLLIPOPS?
MODERATOR: Sure, let's take a quick break to talk about tonight's debate's sponsor, HoneyBear Incoporated, and their new product, ADJECTIVE LOLLIPOPS.
Badass music 1
JOHN: That's right, from the same lovable company that brought you SQUIGGLY SUCKERS,
JOHN: which also happens to be the same company that 90% of America works for and makes 90% of all products,
JOHN: comes a brand new candy! It's called ADJECTIVE LOLLIPOPS!
MODERATOR: Wow! I can't wait to try one of those LOLLIPOPS! I bet they're super ADJECTIVE!
JOHN: They sure are! Now with 15% more ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE!
JOHN: Imagine, if you will, a LOLLIPOP so incredible, so mind-boggling, so ADJECTIVE, so jam-packed with ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE...
JOHN: that is transcends the boundaries of reality.
JOHN: It's gonna tickle your little taste buds just right!
MODERATOR: Just right?
JOHN: Just right!
MODERATOR: Can I try one?
JOHN: Only if you vote for me!
JOHN: Now, everyone please rise for the official HoneyBear company anthem!
JOHN: "I want LOLLIPOPS in my mouth!"
Meanwhile MODERATOR: (Stand up and raise your hand) "I want LOLLIPOPS in my mouth!"
TYPEWRITER: I want LOLLIPOPS in my mouth!

GAMER: (Die)
MODERATOR: (Listening to ear-device) The people of America are now voting... the polls will be closed in five seconds...

Peaceful fantasy music
WIZARD: Greetings, DEVOURER OF CHAOS, Sorcerer of the Ninth Realm.
SORCERER: Salutations, uh... I'm sorry, what was your name again? I'm terrible with names.
WIZARD: MERLIN. My name is MERLIN. We attended magic school together for like... 5 years.
SORCERER: Ah, PigFarts university. I remember it like it was a century ago.
WIZARD: Ha! I believe it was two centuries ago!
SORCERER: (Laughing) Who's counting! Haha!
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Laughing together)
SORCERER: Hey, can I ask you something? You ever turn your staff into a snake just for fun?
WIZARD: Just for fun? I guess you can say that. WINK! (Wink at SORCERER)
Alien teleport, Magic sound, Teleport HUMAN to CENTER STAGE
HUMAN: (Surprised, confused!) Wha--What happened? (Look around) Where am I?
HUMAN: (Thinking hard) The last thing I remember was... driving through a FRANCHISE drive-through?
HUMAN: (Looking around) And now I'm in a fantasy world full of... Wizards?
WIZARD: Greetings, good fellow! I am MERLIN, wizard of this realm.
SORCERER: And I am DEVOURER OF CHAOS, Sorcerer of the Ninth Realm.
HUMAN: I must have been Isekai-ed into a completely different universe!
HUMAN: I mean uh... "realm."
HUMAN: (Pointing) And is that a... MUSHROOM in the distance?
SORCERER: (Looking over shoulder) Oh yeah, the MUSHROOM. We have plenty of those here.
WIZARD: You're not from this realm, are you, stranger?
SORCERER: Does your world not have MUSHROOM?
HUMAN: No. But we do have FRANCHISE.
SORCERER: (Struggling to pronounce word) ...FRANCHISE? What manner of sorcery is that?
WIZARD: I think I know a spell called "Abra-ka-FRANCHISE".
SORCERER: Do you want to try it?
WIZARD: Couldn't hurt.
WIZARD: (Channeling a magical incantation) Abra-ka-FRANCHISE!
Meanwhile SORCERER: (Channeling a magical incantation) Abra-ka-FRANCHISE!
Thunder, Magic sound
Peaceful fantasy music
SORCERER: (Surprised) Oh! That's silly. (Feeling mouth) It turned my teeth into MATERIAL.
WIZARD: Fascinating! I shall write this down in my scroll. (Pull out a scroll and write in it)
HUMAN: Hmm, I was driving my VEHICLE through the FRANCHISE drive-through...
HUMAN: Have you wizards seen my VEHICLE come out of some kind of portal, or rift, or something?
WIZARD: VEHICLE? Indeed! A strange monstrosity labeled "VEHICLE" manifested itself in the forest just hours ago.
HUMAN: Where can I find it? Perhaps I can use it to return to my world.
WIZARD: Good luck with that. We saw a gang of goblins loot that VEHICLE almost immediately.
SORCERER: Looked like they were trying to convert it into some kind of battle-wagon tricked out with enchanted VEHICLE armor.
WIZARD: They're still working on it but believe me, so far, it looks pretty sick.
HUMAN: Darn. How am I going to get back to my Earth, now?
WIZARD: Earth? Why, you're standing on it, dear, boy! Ha! (Laugh to self)
SORCERER: (Laughing together) This poor chap doesn't even know the four elements of which our realm is composed! What a fool! Ha ha ha!
Meanwhile WIZARD: (Laugh together, mocking the HUMAN)
HUMAN: (Not amused) I do happen to know the elements, Wizards. In fact, I'm a chemistry student.
HUMAN: And on my planet, which is called EARTH, we have 118 elements.
SORCERER: Oh yeah? Name every element.
HUMAN: Okay. Uh, Hydrogen... Helium...
WIZARD: (Breaking out in laughter) "Helium!" Ha! You're definitely making that up.
Meanwhile SORCERER: (Break out in laughter and point at the HUMAN mockingly)
SORCERER: Ha! Every knows the four elements are Earth, Water, Fire, and ELEMENT!
HUMAN: You know what, I don't need this. I'm gonna go find a way back home.
SORCERER: Okay, chump! Good luck finding your way out of this forest with all the "CREATUREs" lurking about!
WIZARD: (Quietly to SORCERER) Shh, don't give him any hints.
HUMAN: You Wizards are real jerks (Start to leave, but hesitate) Wait... did you say CREATURE?
SORCERER: Why yes, there are CREATURE all throughout these woods!
SORCERER: Hiding behind every MUSHROOM, in fact!
HUMAN: Why do you say it like that? Should I be worried about these CREATUREs?
SORCERER: (Coy) I don't know... should you?
HUMAN: Well, when you say it like that, I'm not so sure I want to go venturing off without some protection...
HUMAN: Are you guys going to help me or what?
WIZARD: (Walk up to Human) You know, I feel bad for you, Human.
WIZARD: With your flimsy little arms and fragile BODY PART (Fiddle with HUMAN's BODY PART)
HUMAN: What's wrong with my BODY PART?
WIZARD: Allow me to cast a spell of moderate protection.
SORCERER: Yeah, that's fair. If you die, who will we mock for our amusement?
HUMAN: (Pondering) I've never been under a magic spell before.
HUMAN: Unless you count listening to SONG nonstop when I was in high school.
WIZARD: What a coincidence. That's exactly the incantation to this spell.
SORCERER: (Gather near the human) Let's begin the spell. Ready, MERLIN?
WIZARD: Ready, DEVOURER OF CHAOS.
WIZARD: (Chanting, waving arms around) SONG, SONG, SONG

JACOB: (Fiddling in kitchen) Did you eat all the PIZZA ROLLS?
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Sitting on couch playing on phone)
TREVOR: (Sitting on couch playing on phone) No way. I didn't eat what was left of your delicious PIZZA ROLLS.
JACOB: Are you sure? I could have sworn there were at least several PIZZA ROLLS left.
TREVOR: (Sitting on couch) Yeah yeah whatever. Hey man. Check out this pic. (Hold out cellphone)
Meanwhile JACOB: (Do stuff in the kicthen)
JACOB: (Shielding eyes, looking away) Oh no. Nope. Not falling for that again.
JACOB: (Wagging finger at TREVOR) Nuh uh
TREVOR: What? (Wiggle phone, invitingly) Come on, It's a funny pic, check this out.
JACOB: Last time you wanted to show me a so-called "funny pic", it was a picture of TERRIBLE THING.
TREVOR: Okay, I admin. That was highly uncool of me. Even if it was a little funny.
TREVOR: But I promise, this isn't like that. C'mon, check out this pic. It's worth it.
JACOB: (Disbelief) Oh yeah? What's it a picture of, then?
TREVOR: (Holding out phone and not even looking at it) It's... a picture of my PETANIMAL.
TREVOR: (Unconvincingly) It's... a meme of my PETANIMAL, actually!
JACOB: (Disbelief) What does this "Meme" say? What's the text on it?
TREVOR: I'm not gonna spoil it by reading it out loud. You have to see for yourself. That's the whole point.
JACOB: No! Before I commit to engaging with that meme, I need definitive proof that it's not a picture of TERRIBLE THING.
JACOB: Or anything else of that nature.
MARTHA: (Enter) What's all this commotion? And are there any PIZZA ROLLS left?
TREVOR: (To MARTHA) Hey, Martha. Check out this pic on my phone. (Hold out phone)
Meanwhile MARTHA: (Don't look at the phone just yet)
JACOB: (Urgently) DO NOT do it!
MARTHA: What's the matter? Why can't I just look at that pic?
JACOB: (Shielding MARTHA, whispering to her) It's a prank, it's probably a picture of HORRIBLE THING or something like that.
JACOB: Don't encourage this. Just ignore it. Save yourself. You're still pure. You can get away.
TREVOR: Don't listen to Jacob. He's just hangry for PIZZA ROLLS.
Meanwhile JACOB: (Gesture for MARTHA to leave the room)
TREVOR: (Pointing to phone) This is just a meme of my PETANIMAL. That's all. It's pretty funny.
TREVOR: So instead of questioning my motivations, why don't you check it out yourself? (Hold out phone)
JACOB: Martha, for the love of PIZZA ROLLS, if you value your eyeballs, don't look at that PETANIMAL meme.
MARTHA: You guys have some kind of problem you need to work out. I'm not sure I want to get involved.
JACOB: Thank you!
TREVOR: You know what? Don't look at this meme of my PETANIMAL.
TREVOR: It's not like I put a lot of time and effort into it.
TREVOR: Studying the greatest memes and learning from them to craft the perfect, witty, ironic meme.
TREVOR: Raising a PETANIMAL from birth. (Turn away sadly)
JACOB: (Throwing arms up in exasperation) Typical. This is so typical.
JACOB: (To MARTHA, but loud) This is classic Trevor-reverse-psychology.
JACOB: (Suddenly remembering) AND! Last time he said he raised a SNAKE. Remember the SNAKE thing?
JACOB: But it was all an elaborate excuse to get you to look at a video of a SNAKE IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
JACOB: (Up close to TREVOR) You're a sick individual.
TREVOR: (Holding up phone) Check it out.
Meanwhile JACOB: (Shield your eyes and don't look at the phone) No!
MARTHA: This is ridiculous. Now I'm super intrigued. I simply must see this PETANIMAL meme.
TREVOR: (Coy) You sure?
MARTHA: Yeah. Sure. Show me.
TREVOR: You trust me?
MARTHA: Yeah.
TREVOR: (To JACOB) See, Martha trusts me.
JACOB: (Facing away proudly) That's a mistake.
MARTHA: Oh, don't be such a coward. Besides, I'm so desensitized to videos of IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION at this point, who cares?
MARTHA: I've even made a few IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION memes myself.
MARTHA: (Grabbing TREVOR's phone) Let me see that.
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Martha takes your phone to look at it)
TREVOR: Check it out!
MARTHA: (Taking a moment to read the meme) Okay.
JACOB: (Watching in anticipation) Well? Did you fall for it?
MARTHA: I mean, it's just a picture of a PETANIMAL DOING STUFF.
MARTHA: And it has the caption, MEME CAPTION
JACOB: No way. Let me see this. (Grab phone from MARTHA and look at it)
MARTHA: It's true.
JACOB: (Reading meme out loud) MEME CAPTION.
JACOB: Well, I'll be GOBSMACKED and flabbergasted.
MARTHA: Nice meme, Trevor. (High five TREVOR)
Meanwhile TREVOR: (High five MARTHA)
JACOB: (Holding up phone) Okay. What's the catch with this?
TREVOR: (Coy) Jacob, my friend. There is virtually no catch. There's barely anything that should worry you.
JACOB: Well, I guess my day has been slightly improved by looking at this cute little PETANIMAL... (Thinking) wait a second!
JACOB: (Increasingly suspicious) Why are you being so coy? WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NOTHING SIGNIFICANT"?
JACOB: (Strangle TREVOR) WHAT DID YOU DO?
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Get strangled) Bleck! Gurk!
MARTHA: Stop! Let him go! (Pull JACOB away from TREVOR)
Meanwhile JACOB: (MARTHA pulls you away from TREVOR)
JACOB: (To TREVOR) Speak, you fiend.
TREVOR: (Maniacally) You cursed, my good fellow! By gazing upon the forbidden PETANIMAL, and speaking the incantation, you are cursed to die!
TREVOR: Cursed to die... in sixty seconds! (Evil laughter, highly amused)
MARTHA: What the heck, man!
JACOB: What kind of "The Ring" garbage is this? (To audience) Is this seriously the best conclusion the author of this skit could think of?
MARTHA: (To TREVOR) What's wrong with you? Why do this? What's your motivation?
TREVOR: (Serious) In a word.... "chaos."
JACOB: (Strangle TREVOR) You jerk! You lift this curse right now! Or I'll make you IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION!
Meanwhile TREVOR: (Getting strangled) There's nothing-- I can do-- !
MARTHA: (Looking at watch) Wait... it's definitely been at least a minute since we looked at the meme.
JACOB: (Stop strangling TREVOR) It's been a minute? And we're not dead?
JACOB: Perhaps... there is no curse?
TREVOR: (Laughing to self)
JACOB: (To TREVOR, playfully, laughing) Oh Trevor, you jerk. You had me all worried for nothing. Again!
MARTHA: (Laughing playfully) You really are a gullible little guy.
JACOB: (Sighing, putting arm around TREVOR) Classic Trevor.
MARTHA: (Looking at watch) But just to be safe, I think we should give it a few more seconds, though.
MARTHA: And if we're not dead by then, we can-- (YOU SUDDENLY DIE)
Church bell
Tense cinematic music
TREVOR: (Point and laugh at MARTHA's corpse) Hahaha! Another soul falls, in the name of PETANIMAL!

JACOB: I'm gonna-- (YOU SUDDENLY DIE)
Church bell
Lacrimosa music
TREVOR: (Pick up phone from MARTHA's corpse, thinking to self) Now... what to make for my next cursed meme?

HOST: Patricia, whenever you're ready, take it away!

MOTHER: (Endearing) You've been such a good boy this year, Timmy. What would you like for your birthday!
CHILD: I want a pet doggy!
MOTHER: A dog? That's a big responsibility. Okay... but you have to promise to take care of that doggy!
CHILD: I will, I promise!
MOTHER: Make sure you always remember to feed it... "INEDIBLE OBJECT"...
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants) I said, remember to feed your dog "INEDIBLE OBJECT". (Pause for a moment)
CHILD: I will, mom!
MOTHER: (To CHILD) And always take it for a walk... after it eats the "INEDIBLE OBJECT"...
CHILD: Yeah! (Pause awkwardly)
HOST: Contestants, go ahead and ring in whenever you notice something wrong with this scene...
TREVOR: (Watch the actors really intensely for a second)
CHILD: Mommy, are dogs supposed to eat "INEDIBLE OBJECT"?
MOTHER: Why yes Timmy, INEDIBLE OBJECT is made specifically for dogs to eat, inside their mouths.
MOTHER: (Rub stomach, stare at contestants) Mmm, INEDIBLE OBJECT!
Music stops, Gameshow ring
TREVOR: (Point at actors) I know what's wrong.
TREVOR: You don't really need to walk your dog as long as you have enough CLEANING SUPPLIES.
TREVOR: And they have plenty of CLEANING SUPPLIES!
HOST: No, that's... (Utterly confused) What?

ALEXA: The mom's not really hungry for INEDIBLE OBJECT, you can tell by the way she was rubbing her stomach.
ALEXA: I would have rubbed it much more sensually.

TREVOR: He hasn't really been a good boy this year. Just look into his eyes. He's done unspeakable things.
Gameshow ring
ALEXA: I don't like her face.
HOST: Here's a hint: It's something about the DOG FOOD.
Gameshow ring
TREVOR: INEDIBLE OBJECT doesn't go in your mouth, God gave you a specific hole for that.
HOST: Close enough. I guess you earn one point.
HOST: You people are weird. Okay, here's your next scenario.
HOST: Hopefully this one is a bit easier, but I doubt it, since that was the FIRST round...
Guitar music 1
CHILD: Mommy?
MOTHER: What is it, Timmy?
CHILD: Where do babies come from?
MOTHER: Well, you see, Timmy, when mommy and daddy love each other very much, they...
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants) go to CHAIN RESTAURANT and eat SPECIAL INGREDIENT.
MOTHER: (To TIMMY) and nine months later, a baby is born!
CHILD: Wow! SPECIAL INGREDIENT? I had no idea!
MOTHER: (Stare at contestants and shrug) Yup!... Totally true!
Music stops, Gameshow ring
ALEXA: The mom forgot to mention that you can still get pregnant from pre-SPECIAL INGREDIENT.
HOST: That's not correct... seriously?
Gameshow ring
TREVOR: I'm pretty sure pregnancy only lasts 7 months, that's what my wife told me.
TREVOR: Which makes sense, because 9 months before our baby was born she was away on a business trip with her boss and his friends.
Gameshow ring
ALEXA: That's not her real son. The husband swapped out the babies at the hospital and she has no idea.
HOST: None of you are right, let's just move onto the next scenario.

MOTHER: Breathe normally, Timmy! I'll call poison control!
MOTHER: (Take out cellphone, dialing number) 212-802-4444...
MOTHER: (Speaking on phone) Hello, Domino's Pizza? I'd like to order one large pizza pepperoni pizza.
MOTHER: (Staring at contestants) Yes, and a 2 liter of pepsi...
CHILD: (Coughing, vomiting) Mommy... is there supposed to be blood?
MOTHER: Hang in there, Timmy, my son! I'm calling for help right now!
MOTHER: (Talking on phone, speaking very slowly) ... by calling DOMINO'S PIZZA.
MOTHER: (Talking on phone) Why yes, I'll hold...
Music stops, Gameshow ring
TREVOR: She's stupid, if you order on the Domino's app your get a much better deal.
Gameshow ring
ALEXA: The kid doesn't need that much Pepsi, chugging a regular bottle should fix him up real good.
Gameshow ring
TREVOR: (Holding up cellphone) I just called 212-802-4444 and it's a TELEPHONE SERVICE.

ALEXA: She called Domino's Pizza instead of Poison Control.

TYPEWRITER: Secret hideout;Somewhere in upstate New York;11AM Friday
TYPEWRITER: Secret agent CODENAME receives a message from HQ...
AGENT: (Pacing around nervously) It's Friday. This is not good. I should have heard from headquarters by now.
AGENT: If I don't receive a message by the end of the day, my mission to DO GOOD DEED could be a complete failure.
AGENT: Was the pizza delivery last night a secret message in disguise? If so, I might have eaten it by accident.
AGENT: (Peek out the window) No sign of any friendly agents. Maybe something went wrong.
AGENT: (Noticing someone outside) Wait a moment. Who's that walking up to the house?
AGENT: Is that....?!
Doorbell
AGENT: (Calling out) One moment!
AGENT: Hmm. This could be a trap. Better take up a tactical position. (Hide behind the couch and point your gun at the door
Doorbell
AGENT: (Calling out) Come on in, the door's open!
MAILMAN: (Enter stage right) Hello? Are you sure it's okay to come inside? This is highly unconventional.
MAILMAN: (Noticing the agent) Oh, hello. I see you have a gun. I'll just be leaving now.
AGENT: Oh, this? It's just a... toy gun.
AGENT: (Lying) You see, I'm a famous movie star named FAMOUS ACTOR. You may have heard of me.
MAILMAN: FAMOUS ACTOR? Never heard of you. But that explanation makes perfect sense.
AGENT: It's my fool-proof-- I mean, totally accurate backstory.
MAILMAN: (Holding a package) Well, FAMOUS ACTOR, I am here to deliver this very important package.
AGENT: A package you say? Well, I have been expecting to receive something today.
AGENT: (Whispering to self) Perhaps this is a message from headquarters in disguise....
MAILMAN: What are you saying? I can't hear you.
AGENT: Oh, nothing. So, do I have to sign for the package or something?
MAILMAN: Let me just confirm your identity real quick.
MAILMAN: (Reading the package label) It says here... Deliver to FAMOUS ACTOR, 1234 STREETNAME street, New York.
AGENT: That's me.
MAILMAN: (Reading the package label) Contains 1 ORDERABLE ITEM from ORDERABLE ITEM.com.
AGENT: (Whispering to self) I didn't order any ORDERABLE ITEM... headquarters must have sent this.
AGENT: (To mail person) Yes, that's my ORDERABLE ITEM.
AGENT: You see, my old ORDERABLE ITEM broke when I tried to use it to REPAIR THING.
MAILMAN: With all due respect, FAMOUS ACTOR, I don't need to hear your entire life story.
MAILMAN: Technically I'm not even supposed to look inside the package. Anyways, here you go. (Hand it over)
Meanwhile AGENT: (Take the package)
AGENT: (Take the package) Thanks. Have a nice day...
Meanwhile MAILMAN: (Exit)
MAILMAN: (Exit)
AGENT: Time to check out this ORDERABLE ITEM and see what secret messages it contains.
Cellphone vibrate
AGENT: (Checking phone) Who's this calling me? I don't recognize this number.
AGENT: (Answering phone) Who is this?
NARRATOR: Agent CODENAME, is that you?
AGENT: That depends. Who's asking? Who are you?
NARRATOR: My name is not important. What is important is that you do not open that package.
AGENT: You mean this package of ORDERABLE ITEM? How do you know about that?
NARRATOR: Listen closely. That ORDERABLE ITEM contains a CHEMICAL bomb that's set to explode in 60 seconds.
Tense cinematic music
AGENT: A CHEMICAL bomb? That's going to explode in 60 seconds?
AGENT: I just cleaned this room! Now there's going to be CHEMICAL everywhere?
NARRATOR: Focus, agent CODENAME. CHEMICAL on your carpet will be the least of your concerns if you don't dispose of that bomb.
AGENT: What am I supposed to do with this?
NARRATOR: That's for you to figure out. Goodbye, agent CODENAME.
AGENT: (Putting away the phone) They hung up. Darn. Now what am I going to do?
AGENT: (Thinking to self) It's time to make use of my spy training.
AGENT: Let's see.... what about my CERTIFICATION?

Aww
INTERN: That doesn't seem so bad. At least we earned a profitable amount of CURRENCY, right?
BOSS: You imbecile! Our company needs to be making more and MORE CURRENCY each quarter!

SALESPERSON: Ah, but can you really put a price on peace of mind?
SALESPERSON: You're lucky it was I who appeared in the middle of these woods, and not something more sinister...
SALESPERSON: But with this policy, you'll be protected against all sorts of unforeseen dangers and mishaps.
WANDERER: I don't know... I spent all my money on BUYABLE ITEM and my parents won't increase my allowance.
SALESPERSON: It's a very reasonably priced policy. And the benefits highly outweigh the costs.
SALESPERSON: Allow me to elaborate. (Point at the floor)
SALESPERSON: What if you encounter a pit full of CREATUREs? If you fall in, well, you can imagine what might happen.
WANDERER: Oh. Would you say there are many pits full of CREATURE in the woods?
SALESPERSON: Most certainly! And what about a group of TYPE OF PERSON people, who prey on strangers in broad daylight?
WANDERER: Good heavens! I had no idea that TYPE OF PERSON posed that kind of danger!
SALESPERSON: Sorry to scare you, but yes, it's very true.
SALESPERSON: You may also wish to know that NUMBER percent of people who get lost in the woods fall victim to ILLNESS.
WANDERER: Really? ILLNESS? Out in these woods?
SALESPERSON: Of course, ILLNESS is mostly linked to genetics.... (Lean in to tell a secret)
SALESPERSON: But between you and me, I suspect a strong correlation between ILLNESS and FUN ACTIVITY here in the woods.
WANDERER: FUN ACTIVITY in these very woods? Now why would I be doing that?
SALESPERSON: You might come across a TYPE OF PERSON who wants to FUN ACTIVITY. You know, peer pressure.
WANDERER: I suppose if I saw a TYPE OF PERSON doing FUN ACTIVITY then I might be inclined to join in...
SALESPERSON: Exactly! So you'll want an insurance policy to protect you in the event of FUN ACTIVITY ILLNESS.
WANDERER: Well when you put it like that, I would be silly not to have insurance. Where do I sign?
SALESPERSON: Well, it's such a popular policy that I ran out of scrolls.
SALESPERSON: But for now, you can sign my BODY PART. Here's a pen! (Hold out a pen)
WANDERER: (Take the pen and sign the BODY PART) There you go!

(Courtroom music)
TYPEWRITER: Court Case #112389;Becky Brown v. David Dickson
BAILIFF: All rise for the honorable Judge NAME!
JUDGE: (enter stage and sit on judge's chair)
(Music stops)
JUDGE: You may be seated.
BAILIFF: Hello, your honor. This is the case of Brown vs. Dickson. 
JUDGE: Thank you, officer. Lets see... (look over files) It says here that Ms. Becky Brown insists that Mr. David Dickson is the father of her AGE month old child.
JUDGE: However, Mr. Dickson claims the kid isn't his.
JUDGE: Ms. Brown, please give the court a brief history on your relationship with Mr. Dickson.
BECKY: (stand up) Yes, your honor. David and I met back in high school and we were sweethearts until a little over AGE months ago. 
BECKY: I'm not sure what happened, but David didn't seem to love me as much when I became pregnant. 
DAVID: That's because you've been sleeping around!
BECKY: I have not! That's not true!
JUDGE: (bang gavel) There will be order in this court! Ms. Brown, please continue.
BECKY: We had been married for about a year, and then David decided to file for divorce days after I told him we we're gonna start a family!
BECKY: I believe he's just avoiding the responsibility of raising child. (sit down)
JUDGE: Mr. Dickson, what is your statement?
DAVID: (stand up) I'm not going to take care of a child that isn't mine. Becky cheated on me!
DAVID: I left for a business trip, and I came back to a positive pregnancy test.
BECKY: Oh PET, do you not remember that night we had together before you left? We were going for HOURS hours!
DAVID: But we've discussed many times that we aren't ready for kids!
BECKY: How do I know you didn't leave to cheat on me then? You've never left on a business trip before!
DAVID: I got a promotion!
BECKY: You work at WORK!
JUDGE: (bang gavel) Order! Order in my court please. Mr. Dickson, is there any further reason why you believe this child isn't yours?
DAVID: Like I just said, Becky and I have talked about how we wanted to wait to have kids many times.
DAVID: We had just moved to CITY, got new jobs, and we wanted to have enough money saved up first. 
DAVID: Plus, even though our date nights would get a little "involved" sometimes, we were always sure to be safe. (sit down)
JUDGE: Well, anything can happen, no matter how safe you think you're being. This is where the DNA test comes in. 
JUDGE: Bailiff, please retrieve the results.
BAILIFF: Yes, your honor. (leave stage)
BECKY: I just want my husband back. I miss the love we had.
DAVID: I bet you miss our love because the real father doesn't want to take care of the kid either. 
BECKY: I told you a thousand times, I didn't cheat!
DAVID: (sarcastically) Yeah, right. I've seen how you look at the neighbor.
BAILIFF: (return to stage, hand imaginary folder to judge) The results, your honor.
JUDGE: (take imaginary folder from bailiff) Thank you. These results were prepared by DNA Diagnostics, and they read as follows...
JUDGE: In the case of Brown v. Dickson, when it comes to the AGE month old child, it has been determined by this court.....
JUDGE: Mr. David Dickson, you........
JUDGE: ANSWER the father.
DAVID: (react to the results)
BECKY: (react to the results)

WIZARD: Hurry along quickly, NAME, and be careful with that box of potions.
MINION: (Enter stage, carrying a box) Yes, my lord. 
WIZARD: If even one of those bottles break, your debt to me would increase by VALUE pieces of gold.
MINION: I wouldn't dare damage the goods, I swear.
WIZARD: Good. Why don't we set up camp here? It'll be sundown soon.
MINION: Yes, my lord. (Put box down)
WIZARD: We should arrive in town tomorrow if we wake up early enough.
MINION: I shall start assembling the tents.
Meanwhile KNIGHT: (Enter stage left.)
WIZARD: Who goes there?!
KNIGHT: It is I, Sir TITLE. I was told a potion seller might be in these woods, and it appears I've finally found you.
MINION: But we're not... 
WIZARD: Hush, NAME! (whisper to companion) Perhaps we can turn a higher profit by sparing just one potion. 
MINION: Ohhhh... Okay!
KNIGHT: My dear potion seller, I am going into battle, and I want your strongest EFFECT potions.
MINION: I'm afraid these potions are too strong for you, Sir TITLE. 
WIZARD: And possibly too expensive! My strongest potions are reserved for those who can prove they can handle them with their, um, *cough* coin purse. *cough*
KNIGHT: Potion seller, I shall tell you again, I am going into battle, and I want only your strongest EFFECT potions. 
KNIGHT: I serve the His Majesty, Lord KING, and I'm sure he may pay you on my behalf.
WIZARD: You cannot handle my EFFECT potions. They are too strong for you.
KNIGHT: Potion seller, listen to me. I want only your strongest potion.
MINION: These potions would kill you, Sir TITLE. You cannot handle my lord's EFFECT potions.
KNIGHT: Enough of these games! I am going into battle, and I need your strongest potions. 
WIZARD: Unless you can provide VALUE pieces of gold right now, I'm afraid my strongest EFFECT potions would kill you, traveler.
WIZARD: You cannot handle my strongest potions if you do not have the gold.
MINION: You'd better go to a seller that sells weaker potions!
WIZARD: (hit your companion) Hush!
KNIGHT: Potion seller, I'm telling you right now; I am going into battle and I need your strongest potions. 
KNIGHT: Lord KING will surely pay you once the battle is won.
WIZARD: You do not know what you ask, traveler. My strongest EFFECT potions could kill a dragon, let alone a man. They are too strong for you.
KNIGHT: Potion seller, I am telling you I need your strongest potions. I'm going into battle, for gods sake!
KNIGHT: I'm going into battle, and I need your strongest EFFECT potions!
WIZARD: You cannot handle my strongest potions! 
MINION: No one can! 
WIZARD: My strongest potions are not fit for a beast, let alone a man!
KNIGHT: What must I say to get your EFFECT potions, potion seller? I do not have VALUE gold.
KNIGHT: Why won't you trust me with your strongest potions? I need them if I am to be successful in battle! 
WIZARD: I cannot give you my strongest potions because my strongest potions are only for the strongest beings.
WIZARD: And you are of the weakest beings I've seen, Sir TITLE!
MINION: You're weak because you have no gold!
KNIGHT: (sadly) Well... then thats it, potion seller! I'll go elsewhere. I'll go elsewhere for my potions.
WIZARD: That's what you better do.
KNIGHT: (crying) I'll go elsewhere for my EFFECT potions and I'll never come back!
MINION: Good! You're not welcome here!
WIZARD: My EFFECT potions are only for the strongest, and you are clearly not of the strongest men who have heavy bags of gold!
WIZARD: You are the weakest!
KNIGHT: You've had your say, potion seller, but I shall have mine. You are a rascal! A rascal with no respect for knights! 
KNIGHT: No respect for anything... except your EFFECT potions! (run off stage crying)
WIZARD: (to your companion) Why respect knights with no gold when you can sell these to some idiot for double the price in town?

DUNGEON MASTER: Ok, session starts now! Does everyone have their character sheets?
NEWBIE PLAYER: Yeah! 
Meanwhile BORED PLAYER: (Pretend to play games on your phone) Uh huh.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Cackle like a goblin) I THIRST FOR BLOOD.
DUNGEON MASTER: Very good. Last we left off, you were following a MYTHICAL CREATURE into an enchanted glade, when suddenly, you got lost!
NEWBIE PLAYER: I recall! Our MYTHICAL CREATURE guide suddenly disappeared, that rascal! I hope it returns soon.
BORED PLAYER: Huh? I don't remember that.
DUNGEON MASTER: Maybe because you spent the entire last session playing MOBILE GAME on your phone.
BORED PLAYER: (Shrug and play games on your phone) Not my fault MOBILE GAME is more entertaining than your dumb game.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: No! It's gone?! But I was going to pickpocket the MYTHICAL CREATURE and steal its TREASURE while it wasn't looking!
DUNGEON MASTER: I already told you, you can't do that. It's impossible.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: But I rolled a 20! Fine, can I steal its BODY PART when it comes back and sell it back in town?
DUNGEON MASTER: Also impossible. Besides, that would initiate combat. Are you sure you want to do that?
NEWBIE PLAYER: No, no! We're only level 1, and that MYTHICAL CREATURE is supposed to be our guide through these woods.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: And look where it's gotten us! We're lost! We should have killed it while it was WACKY ACTION.
BORED PLAYER: This sucks. I'm bored. I'm ordering a pizza. (Put your phone to your ear) Hi, Instant Pizza? I'd like to place an order.
DUNGEON MASTER: Hey! It's not that boring! Now look, you're lost in a magical wood. It's foggy and there's no signs of civilization. What do you do?
NEWBIE PLAYER: Well, what do we see? Can I roll a Perception check?
DUNGEON MASTER: Sure.
NEWBIE PLAYER: (Roll some dice on the table)
Crashing debris
NEWBIE PLAYER: That's a 12.
Meanwhile BORED PLAYER: (Recoil in shock) What on Earth was that!? (Get back in your seat)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: Nice metal dice! Can I STRANGE ACTION them?
DUNGEON MASTER: You see a path through the woods surrounded by SOMETHING ZANY and thick spider webs. You also see odd tracks in the mud.
NEWBIE PLAYER: (Point to BORED PLAYER) You there, you're a ranger! Do you recognize these odd tracks? Do they belong to the MYTHICAL CREATURE that was guiding us?
BORED PLAYER: (Look up from your phone) Uh, how should I know?
DUNGEON MASTER: You can roll a Survival check, you INSULT.
BORED PLAYER: You're the INSULT, INSULT. (Roll some dice)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: I set the giant spider webs on fire then do a triple front flip somersault through them!
DUNGEON MASTER: Wait your turn, Rogue. Ranger, what was your roll?
Knocking on door
BORED PLAYER: Who cares? Pizza's here. (Walk to the door and open it)
PIZZA GUY: Hi, Instant Pizza! Hot, fresh, ADJECTIVE pizza delivered to your door instantaneously. Sorry I'm late. Here's your pizza with extra TOPPING!
BORED PLAYER: No prob, dude. Come put it on the table. (Walk back to the table)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Follow BORED PLAYER back to the table)
CHAOTIC PLAYER: I changed my mind. I push the wizard into the spider webs!
DUNGEON MASTER: Uhh, ok. Roll Athletics.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Roll some dice) 13! Did I do it? Is the wizard going to be eaten!? (Point at NEWBIE PLAYER) I hope they lay eggs in you! Mwahaha!
NEWBIE PLAYER: You greatly disturb me, Rogue. Dungeon master, can't I dodge or something?
PIZZA GUY: Oh cool, you guys are playing D&D? I'm a dungeon master myself. (Set the pizza down)
DUNGEON MASTER: (Point at Pizza Guy) Yes, and you're very rudely interrupting our game! 
DUNGEON MASTER: Alright Wizard, the Rogue pushes you into the spider webs. Four giant Phase Spiders suddenly appear around you, gnashing their teeth hungrily.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: Yes! Feast upon his squishy magic BODY PART! Mwahaha!
NEWBIE PLAYER: What's with you and your obsession with BODY PARTs?
PIZZA GUY: Wait, doesn't the wizard get to contest the roll?
DUNGEON MASTER: Huh? Contest the roll?
PIZZA GUY: Well that was a shove. According to page 195 of the Player's Handbook, the wizard gets to roll Athletics or Acrobatics to contest the rogue's check.
NEWBIE PLAYER: I do?
DUNGEON MASTER: They do? I mean, yes of course. I knew that! I was just getting to that before you interrupted me.
DUNGEON MASTER: Fine, you can roll, but don't use those metal dice again, or-
Meanwhile NEWBIE PLAYER: (Roll some dice)
Crashing debris
NEWBIE PLAYER: 14. Do I win?
DUNGEON MASTER: (Tired) No, the spider webs are too sticky and- (look at Pizza Guy as you're talked over)
Meanwhile PIZZA GUY: (Loud) Yeah! 14 is higher than 13, so the Rogue fails to push you. Congrats, you're not stuck in the spider webs!
DUNGEON MASTER: Excuse me, but this is my table. You can't just come in here and decide what happens! Make your own game if you want to be the DM.
NEWBIE PLAYER: I don't know, I kind of like the new guy. He kept me from getting eaten by spiders.
BORED PLAYER: He brought us pizza too, so I like him.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: He foiled my plans, but... Hey, pizza guy! You know stuff about this game! Tell me, is it really impossible to steal a BODY PART from a MYTHICAL CREATURE?
PIZZA GUY: Well sure it's possible. There's rules for harvesting body parts, crafting them into magic items, stuff like that. It's all in the books.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You liar! How dare you deprive me of MYTHICAL CREATURE BODY PART?
NEWBIE PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You would've let me die if the pizza guy didn't correct you! I cast SPELL on you!
BORED PLAYER: (Point at DUNGEON MASTER) You keep distracting me from grinding in MOBILE GAME with dice rolls and silly voices.
CHAOTIC PLAYER: (Look at NEWBIE PLAYER.) Mutiny? (Quick nod. Grab DUNGEON MASTER and drag him out the door)
Meanwhile NEWBIE PLAYER: (Look at CHAOTIC PLAYER.) Mutiny? (Quick nod. Grab DUNGEON MASTER and drag him out the door)

Pinky: I think so brain, But I'm not sure how an Oprah singing GHOST that's BOWING would help us with winning the next bingo night.
Brain: No pinky, it's just that I realized you have no experience in the medical field.
Brain: I must perform the surgery myself *puts on disguise*

Pinky: (Giggles) well it is my time of the month.
Brain: (Guides the president to the examination table) Never mind her, now come President NICKSON. We both know you are in a big hurry.
President: (lays on examination table) That's right, Today is my grand speech to the world. I just need to know if my TEETH are all in good shape.

Brain: This will be over in a bit. Nurse, pin him down while I get the replacement.
President: Nurse, tell me. Is my TEETH that bad?
Pinky: Well this wouldn't be appropriate to say in the workplace but with TEETH like that, I don't believe we would make it on the first date.
Brain: (walks over) Quite Pinky- I mean nurse, Just hold him as I-
President: Wait! hold on just a moment-

Meanwhile FRIAR LAWRENCE: (Act as if you are waiting for Juliet to arrive)
JULIET: Greetings, Friar Lawrence. You sent for me?
FRIAR LAWRENCE: Yes, Juliet. Our meeting is of much importance.
FRIAR LAWRENCE: I understand that your parents have arranged a marriage that is most distressing to you.
JULIET: I am afraid so, friar. My true love lies with the fair Romeo, but my parents would never permit such a marriage, for our families are sworn rivals!
FRIAR LAWRENCE: Fear not, Juliet, for I have a plan! (Pull out a baggy) I shall pump you full of DRUG, and lots of it!
JULIET: With all due respect, friar, I am not looking to get turnt up tonight. The only high I seek is the lasting high of love!
FRIAR LAWRENCE: Oh no, I believe you misunderstand, dear Juliet! The purpose of your DRUG intake is not for the GREAT effects!
FRIAR LAWRENCE: The intention is to put you into a coma; one which makes you appear dead, only to awaken once more!
FRIAR LAWRENCE: Like a phoenix that now has a slightly higher risk of cancer!
JULIET: I don't know, friar; it sounds awfully risky!
FRIAR LAWRENCE: There is no need to worry, Juliet! I have tested the method on myself NUMBER1 times, and it has worked every time!
FRIAR LAWRENCE: And the best part? I don't have a problem, and I can stop at any time! No matter what my ye olde therapist says!
JULIET: Very well, friar. I would do anything for my dear Romeo! Even if it means overdosing on copious amounts of DRUG!
JULIET: (Take the DRUG from the friar and consume it)

ROMEO: Perhaps just one more kiss from your succulent corpse lips! For old time's sake... (Bestow an awkwardly long, messy kiss)
ROMEO: (Pull back from the kiss) Mmm, a hint of DRUG! Must have been her new lipstick.
Noir music 1
ROMEO: (Stand up) Very well. I know what I must do! I can not stand to live anymore... not without you, Juliet!
ROMEO: (Retrieve a flask from your side) It's a good thing that I brought a flask of POISON with me. Drinking this should be enough to do me in!
ROMEO: Juliet, I shall join you and FIRSTCELEBRITY in the great beyond! (Drink the poison and collapse to the ground next to Juliet's body)
JULIET: (Immediately sit up, yawn, and stretch as if waking up from a really good nap)

MEDIUM: I must focus upon my FOCUS even harder! (vigorously rub FOCUS)
MEDIUM: It starts with a J... or a Q? or perhaps even a 4? Sounds a little like SILLY WORD.
GHOST: Are you even listening!? I just told you, my name is GHOST! Not some idiot out there!

MEDIUM: Aha! Audience! Is there a AUDIENCE MEMBER in the crowd? The spirit wishes to speak to you!
GHOST: No I don't! I don't want to talk to anyone! I don't even know how you got in my house!
MEDIUM: AUDIENCE MEMBER, do you know anyone who has died whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet? Tell me, the great NAME!
Meanwhile GHOST: Shoo, shoo! Get out of my house!
MEDIUM: Ah, yes! This ghost's name starts with one of those letters! It must be... DEAD GUY! Yes! I, the great NAME, have channeled the spirit of DEAD GUY!
GHOST: For the last time, my name is GHOST! Maybe if you'd stop repeating your own name, you'd hear mine! Now get out!
MEDIUM: AUDIENCE MEMBER, DEAD GUY has a message for you! But alas, I feel my powers waning! Only a generous cash donation can reestablish my link to the dead!
GHOST: So that's your angle, huh? You're a no good scam artist! Well I won't stand for it!
MEDIUM: Ah, I can feel the generosity of our many donors! The message from DEAD GUY is coming to me!
GHOST: I'm warning you, phony. If you don't leave right now, I'm gonna... I'm gonna do something drastic!
MEDIUM: The message is clear to me! AUDIENCE MEMBER, are you ready!?
GHOST: Forget this. They can't even see me. I'm just gonna possess 'em.

MAIN DETECTIVE: (point towards crime board) For the past 3 months, I have been tracking down this one person, goes by the name VNO, head of a major crime ring.
MAIN DETECTIVE: That rings name goes by CRN, yeah I know, shocker.
MAIN DETECTIVE: But they do hide their deals well through CRN.
MAIN DETECTIVE: They mainly deal substances around the same tune as SBS which has killed many people due to its sheer addictiveness.
MAIN DETECTIVE: (go back to chair) But, no matter what pieces of evidence I find I always seem like I'm going in circles.
MAIN DETECTIVE: I mean there combined inventory of SBS Is probably around the tune of like MSC dollars and somehow we cant trace any amount of that size towards any leads.
MAIN DETECTIVE: I just think I need a rest, Its been a long day. I'm just gonna rest on my chair for a while.

MAIN DETECTIVE: Buddy this better be a joke and you came in here with a reason.
UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: Well there's no way we can both pay rent on this building.

UNKNOWING DETECTIVE: Why didn't you just poison the water with SBS, like that could have killed us and you just chose not too.
MASTERMIND NEWSBOY: (get off ground) Hey I didn't ask for your opinion! Its not like I see you being a villain!

TEACHER: Settle down, students. You all know why you're in detention.
ALICE: This is stupid. I didn't even do anything bad.
ALICE: Why do I have to stay after school for THREE HOURS with these totally uncool dimwits?
BOBBY: (Offended) Who are you calling dim wit?
BOBBY: (Proud) I scored 110% on Mr. Gottfried's GEOGRAPHY test!
CHRIS: (Raising hand) I forget why I'm here, too. Can you give us refresher?
CHRIS: I'm gonna be late for FOOTBALL practice!
TEACHER: You all are being punished for what you did to the school mascot, FRUMPY the DRAGON.
ALICE: That stupid DRAGON had it coming.
CHRIS: FRUMPY the DRAGON looked at me funny. And as the most "badass" kid in school, I can't let that slide.
ALICE: So we PRANK. It had to be done.
CHRIS: It has to be done, it had to be PRANK.
TEACHER: (Sigh) Which is why our school specifically has a policing against PRANK.
BOBBY: (Nerdy) Erm actually, I only came up with the idea to PRANK, however, I did not actually execute the plan, heh.
ALICE: Shut up you nerd!

BOBBY: Nobody could PRANK me. I would clearly outsmart them and counter-attack like a NINJA.
CHRIS: My dad makes me feel UPSET every other night if I don't win at the FOOTBALL games.
ALICE: Who cares if the DRAGON mascot is UPSET, so what?
ALICE: The DRAGON mascot doesn't even look like a DRAGON.
TEACHER: That's because you're bad at life

MASCOT: You know what, I'm fed up with this. Last year it was OTHERJOKE, this year it's PRANK.
MASCOT: And these kids don't even care that I'm UPSET.

MISS SCARLETT: Yes, well, we shall see if your alibis hold up. Now let's examine the available evidence. Where exactly was Mr. NOUN9 found?
PROFESSOR PLUM: His body was in the NOUN5, right on the floor. Poor chap.
MISS SCARLETT: And the murder weapon?
MRS. PEACOCK: (Gasping) Oh, it was something dreadful—a NOUN6, if you can believe it! Such a lovely piece, turned into an instrument of death.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Inspecting the cards) And what of the fingerprint analysis and the footprints? We can't overlook any detail, no matter how small.
MISS SCARLETT: Precisely, Colonel. Now, we all had access to a NOUN6, and it could easily have been transported to the NOUN5.
MISS SCARLETT:  We must scrutinize our evidence and interrogate one another until cracks in our stories are revealed.
TYPEWRITER: After lots of discoveries later
Shark Tank serious music 1
MISS SCARLETT: (Holding up a notepad) Now, let's recount our discoveries. Colonel Mustard, you claim to have been in the NOUN4. 
MISS SCARLETT: But a torn matchbook from the lounge was found in your Jacket. Care to explain?
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Stammering) Well, yes, I... I might have stopped by the NOUN1. But for a harmless drink! It means nothing, I assure you.
PROFESSOR PLUM: (Intrigued) A drink, you say? Or perhaps to pick up a handy NOUN6?
MRS. PEACOCK: But let's not forget the NOUN8 found beside the flowerpot in the conservatory.
MRS. PEACOCK: This means somebody could have used to stroll through the secret passage to the NOUN3.
MISS SCARLETT: (Eyeing Mrs. Peacock) A valid point. The secret passages aren't common knowledge, Mrs. Peacock. Your familiarity is... curious.
MRS. PEACOCK: (Whispering to themself) This is not how it was supposed to...
MISS SCARLETT: (Overhearing) Something you’d like to share with the group, Mrs. Peacock?
PROFESSOR PLUM: And let's not overlook the NOUN7 found in NOUN3—a perfect tool for a... scholarly type to utilize in a violent manner.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Nodding) Ah, Professor, were you not alone with your precious books around the time of the... incident?
MISS SCARLETT: (Tapping the notepad) We've had our share of bluffs and deflections. It's time we cut through the noise. 
MISS SCARLETT: The NOUN7 was also found dusted with ash—suggesting it was recently near the fireplace here in this very room.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Pointedly) Well then, Detective, it seems you're the only one without a suspect item tied to 'em. How do we know it wasn't you?
MISS SCARLETT: (Smiling slightly) Because, dear Colonel, unlike our hidden assailant, I do not stand to gain from Mr. NOUN9's untimely demise. 
MISS SCARLETT: And my fingerprints were not found on the murder weapon.
MISS SCARLETT: The NOUN8, the NOUN7, the scattered pages from Mr. NOUN9's diary—all of these paint a damning picture. It is time for the culprits to reveal themselves.
MISS SCARLETT: (Slowly) And that person is...
MISS SCARLETT: (With finality) Mrs. Peacock!

MRS. PEACOCK: (Shocked) Me? Oh, Detective, surely you jest! How could you possibly think that I, a lady of my standing, could commit such a heinous act?
MISS SCARLETT: (Raising an eyebrow) The clues do not lie, Mrs. Peacock. Yes, everyone had access to a NOUN6, but not everyone had a motive.
MISS SCARLETT: The torn page from the guestbook found near the body contained a cryptic message in your handwriting.
MISS SCARLETT: And the orchid you so admire—its specific pollen was found on Mr. NOUN9's cuff.
PROFESSOR PLUM: Quite the deduction, Detective. It's always the details that give the game away.
COLONEL MUSTARD: And what about the footprints leading to the NOUN3? A distinctive tread pattern that matches none other than Mrs. Peacock's heels!
MRS. PEACOCK: This is preposterous! I've been framed! I would never soil my hands with such... such...
MISS SCARLETT: ...guilt? I do believe you protested a tad too much throughout our investigation. 
MISS SCARLETT: The truth always emerges, Mrs. Peacock. As they say, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
COLONEL MUSTARD: (Nodding with satisfaction) Splendid work, Detective. Justice will be served tonight.
MRS. PEACOCK: It... It was the money, you see. Mr. NOUN9 threatened to cut me off, to reveal my little... indiscretions. I couldn't allow that.
MISS SCARLETT: (Sympathetically) A tragic end to a desperate measure.
Knocking on door
POLICEMAN: Detective Scarlet, we received your call. Is this the suspect?
MISS SCARLETT: (Nods) Yes, officer. Take her into custody.
POLICEMAN: (Handcuffs Mrs. Peacock) Put your hands behind your back, Mrs. Peacock, you're going away for a long time.
Meanwhile MRS. PEACOCK: (Puts her hands behind her back as she gets cuffed)
POLICEMAN: (Walks out of the room with Mrs. Peacock)
Meanwhile MRS. PEACOCK: (Walks out of the room with the policeman) Let me go! These are just filthy liars!
MISS SCARLETT: Another case closed, thanks to deduction and attention to detail. Although, let's hope our next gathering is under less... murderous circumstances.

MODERATOR: Welcome to debate number NUMBER of the next United States presidential election! 
applause
MODERATOR: This year’s candidates are still running neck-and-neck in the polls, so this is their last chance to make their case.
MODERATOR: So, let’s get right to it. First, please join me in extending a warm welcome to our first candidate, Senator NAME 1!
applause
CANDIDATE 1: Thank you! Thank you all.
MODERATOR: And on the opposite side of the political spectrum, let’s give it up for our second candidate, Governor NAME 2!
applause
CANDIDATE 2: Good evening, everyone! Thank you for voting for me!
laughter
MODERATOR: Now let’s not get ahead of ourselves, but let’s get right to it.
MODERATOR: Senator NAME 1, do you support POLITICAL ISSUE?
CANDIDATE 1: Well, I have friends who support POLITICAL ISSUE, and I have friends who oppose POLITICAL ISSUE.
CANDIDATE 1: And if you want to know where I stand – I stand with my friends!
MODERATOR: So, you’re basically a pro-friends candidate.
CANDIDATE 1: That’s right.
applause
MODERATOR: Okay then. Governor NAME 2. Do you support war or peace?
CANDIDATE 2: Well, that depends on what you mean. 
CANDIDATE 2: Like, what do you really mean when you say “war”? And, are you talking about “peace peace,” or just about “PEACEFUL THING”?
MODERATOR: You may define the terms however you like.
CANDIDATE 2: So, there’s the question. War or peace? Peace or war? What really matters is what you stand for.
MODERATOR: “What really matters is what you stand for.” Profound indeed. May we quote you on that?
CANDIDATE 2: Absolutely.
applause
MODERATOR: Great. Okay. So now let’s get down to the things that really set you apart. Senator NAME 1 – FOOD 1 or FOOD 2?
CANDIDATE 1: FOOD 1.
MODERATOR: And Senator NAME 2, same question for you. FOOD 1 or FOOD 2?
CANDIDATE 2: FOOD 2. Definitely.
MODERATOR: So, there you have it, folks. A clear distinction. Now for the twist – what about voters who don’t like either FOOD 1 or FOOD 2, but like FOOD 3 instead?
CANDIDATE 1: That's what third parties are for.
CANDIDATE 2: I agree. Let those people vote for somebody else.
MODERATOR: Wow – bipartisan agreement. What a tough choice this election year is going to be!
applause
MODERATOR: Okay, the next question is to Senator NAME 1. What would you sell your soul for?
CANDIDATE 1: Um, I'm afraid that ship's already sailed.
MODERATOR: Excuse me?
CANDIDATE 1: Yeah, sorry, I have nothing left to sell.
MODERATOR: Well then. Governor NAME 2, what about you? What would you sell your soul for?
CANDIDATE 2: Actually, I've already taken out one primary mortgage on my soul, and I've already taken out two soul equity loans, so there's that. 
MODERATOR: So basically, you're an all-in candidate. In for a penny, in for a pound, is that right?
CANDIDATE 2: Yes, that's right. Once I set my mind to something, I'll do anything to get it done.
applause
MODERATOR: Very good, both of you. So, let’s get to closing statements. Senator NAME 1, why should the American people vote for you?
CANDIDATE 1: My fellow Americans, for too long, FOOD 2 has dominated the culinary landscape. 
CANDIDATE 1: Don’t you think it’s high time that FOOD 1 is mandated to be offered by every restaurant and cafeteria in our country?
CANDIDATE 1: A vote for NAME 1 is a vote for FOOD 1.
MODERATOR: Very persuasive. Governor NAME 2, your turn. Why should the American people vote for you instead?
CANDIDATE 2: I can think of one very good reason.
CANDIDATE 2: Because VERY GOOD REASON.

RECEPTIONIST: Oh my god, the poor baby. What is wrong with you? Should we be calling the police?
DOCTOR: I believe that's not gonna be necessary. Karen was just leaving.
KAREN: What? You said i have to wait!
DOCTOR: I said you would have had to wait. But instead, you're making a huge scene. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the property.

DOCTOR: NAME2 has ILLNESS , a terminal illness that will kill him in approximately the next 20 days.
SICK KID: (Shocked) WHAT? You said 15 months at our last appointment! (Freak out and start crying and coughing)
DOCTOR: I did, but that was before you told me about all of the MED1 earlier.

RED: Good evening. Thank you all for coming to this emergency meeting.
GREEN: But what's the emergency, Red? Did Blue eat your FOOD again?
BLUE: Shut up, Green!
RED: No, nothing like that. This problem is far more serious...
RED: (look at audience) We have a OCCUPATION among us!
vine boom
PURPLE: What?! A OCCUPATION? That's impossible!
RED: Unfortunately, Purple, it's the truth. I can't deny the evidence I witnessed.
RED: It was only a couple of minutes ago that I walked into the ROOM. That's where I saw it:
RED: The dead body of NAME!
BLUE: (gasp) Somebody killed NAME?! You monster! They were my favorite crewmate!
GREEN: (look at audience) Who would do such a thing among us?

RED: That's what we're here to find out. One of you is the OCCUPATION behind the murder of NAME.
RED: Clearly, it couldn't have been me, because I'm the one who called this meeting.
PURPLE: It wasn't me, either! I was busy TASK.
RED: Then that leaves three suspects. Got anything to say for yourselves?
BLUE: You said the body was in the ROOM? That's interesting...
BLUE: (point at Green) Because the last time I saw Green, they were heading into the ROOM with NAME!
GREEN: What? You're lying! I did no such thing! I haven't been in the ROOM all day!
GREEN: (point at Blue) I think you're making that up because YOU'RE the killer!
BLUE: Oh come on! Of course the OCCUPATION would try and pin it on the one accusing them!
GREEN: And that's exactly the kind of thing the OCCUPATION would say to avoid suspicion!
BLUE: Oh yeah? Well... INSULT!
GREEN: No, INSULT!
BLUE: Nuh uh!
GREEN: The hell you mean nuh uh?!
BLUE: (talking over Green) You serve no purpose in life! Your life is nothing! You serve zero purpose! You should vote yourself off NOW!

PURPLE: Will the both of you SHUT UP?!
PURPLE: Just because you stopped being RELATIONSHIP with each other doesn't mean you should throw out false accusations!
RED: Purple is right. All this meaningless arguing back and forth gets us nowhere.
RED: If this continues... (look at audience) the OCCUPATION will continue to fester among us.

RED: What's the matter, Yellow? ANIMAL got your tongue?
YELLOW: Oh- no- nothing like that! I was just- um- uh- thinking about- THING! Yes, THING!
RED: Hmm, yes, I see. And what does that have to do with the murder of NAME?
YELLOW: Okay- listen- I know I look really sus right now- but- trust me, I didn't do it!
YELLOW: I definitely didn't kill NAME in the ROOM with a WEAPON!

PRISONER: I'll never tell you! You'll never defeat us!
ROBOT: Oh, but we will. That pitiful NUMBER we killed when we abducted you was only the beginning. We will destroy all humans.
PRISONER: Is that so? All humans?
ROBOT: Yes, all humans.
PRISONER: (Point to fake robot) Then what about that one over there?
ROBOT: That is a robot.

PRISONER: How does that prove you're a robot?!
FAKER: That was me... using my... robot BODY PART!
PRISONER: Robot BODY PART?!
ROBOT: It is true. Humans do not have a robot BODY PART, so he must be a robot.
PRISONER: What if they're lying about being a robot? Did you ever think of that, you bucket of bolts?
ROBOT: Then they are a human and they must perish! They and all other humans must be DEATH, as it clearly states in the cyber-creed!
FAKER: I'm a robot! I swear! They're the only one that needs to be DEATH!
ROBOT: Just as I thought. Problem solved.
PRISONER: I swear, you robots are the worst.
FAKER: See? I am a robot! You said it yourself!

STEPHEN: We don’t have to worry about the dangers of being bitten, eaten, or poisoned by any other fish!
CHARLIE: Umm false. You poison us everyday with that stinky (FISHPART), and I just can’t stand it anymore.
CHARLIE: Every breath I take makes me gag and I think its starting to effect the sheen on my scales.

STEPHEN: Well, I do remember one face that looked pretty (ADJECTIVE). Kinda like that one passing us now.

CHARLIE: Did your mom also tell you to wear a swim shirt at the pool?
SARAH: ALRIGHT! So Stephen, which one of us won the game? I'm starving so lets wrap this up.
STEPHEN: Neither. You two don't deserve a second meal. In fact, I'm just gonna eat YOUR portions the next time the caretaker drops it in.

HERO: Don't get so cocky! I've already slain all the minions you've sent to stop me!

VILLAIN: Sorry, Director. I guess I just really want to ACTION.
DIRECTOR: I don't want an apology or an excuse, I want you to remember your lines!
DIRECTOR: Seriously, what kind of villain would ACTION after killing the hero? It makes no sense!
HERO: A pretty cool villain, if you ask me...

SON: (short pause) A FRANKENSTEIN?
DAD: Yeah! You know, big, ugly mean monster guy! You tellin' me you don't know what a FRANKENSTEIN is?
SON: Dad, I know who FRANKENSTEIN is. Why are you saying there's one up in the attic?
DAD: Do I look like I know how a FRANKENSTEIN would get into the attic? Maybe one laid its eggs in the insulation or something.

SON: I'm pretty sure FRANKENSTEIN wouldn't lay eggs in the insulation.
DAD: What, you a FRANKENSTEIN expert all of a sudden?
(LAUGHTER)
SON: Okay dad, why specifically are you saying a fictional movie monster is up in the attic?
DAD: 'Cos it's up there! You think I'd be standin' down here, tellin' you there's a FRANKENSTEIN in the ATTIC if there wasn't a FRANKENSTEIN in the attic?
(LAUGHTER)
SON: I mean, given we're talking about a fictional character, yeah, I'd say you would.
DAD: Are you sayin' I'm a LIAR?!
SON: No, I'm saying you saw something else up there. Maybe it was a RACCOON.
DAD: You'd think I'd mistake a RACCOON for a FRANKENSTEIN? I've had a RACCOON up in the attic, first time I've ever had a FRANKENSTEIN!

SON: Well how do you know it's a FRANKENSTEIN anyway?
DAD: What, you think I waited around for him to pull out his ID? Do I look like an official FRANKENSTEIN inspector to you?

SON: Okay, listen, we're not going anywhere.
DAD: Why not?
SON: Because I think you're just making this up.
DAD: So you are calling me a LIAR!
SON: I think this is just a ridiculous excuse for you to get out of doing your half of the chores!
DAD: You really think I'd make up something that serious?!
SON: It's not serious, it's stupid! You really expect me to believe that a FRANKENSTEIN is up in the attic?!
DAD: Well...If you don't believe me, you can just stay here.
SON: I will!
DAD: And when you get torn apart by the FRANKENSTEIN, I'll just have to say "that was my poor son, he didn't listen to his dad about the FRANKENSTEIN."

LADY: (chuckle) That's right. Miss COLOR, in the flesh.
DETECTIVE: Miss COLOR. So you're eliminating a threat to your gang.
LADY: Oh no. You won't see a gang. By the end, we'll be an empire, even stretching to the farthest reaches of COUNTRY.
DETECTIVE: (to the audience) So that's her plan. Expanding her gang of criminal ACTIONING thugs to go global.
DETECTIVE: I had to think fast, or I'd be dead.
DETECTIVE: (to the lady, pointing a gun) Not so fast, Miss COLOR. Before we tango, I got a question for you.
LADY: (slightly puzzled) Yes? Go on.
DETECTIVE: If your CREATURE truly is missing, I'd be willing to help you with finding him or her.
LADY: (dropping her gun, shocked) R-really? Even if I'm a criminal?
DETECTIVE: I'm not a monster. My job is to investigate things. If I'm lucky, we'll be done by the morning. (put away the gun)
LADY: Then you'll help me?

DETECTIVE: Of course, Miss COLOR. As long as you're willing to turn yourself in quietly afterwards.
LADY: A-alright. Then... how long will I be punished for?
DETECTIVE: Depending on what the court says, I'd say a minimum of NUMBER TIME-FRAME. Plus a fee.
LADY: How much of a fee?
DETECTIVE: I'd say around NUMBER.
LADY: Wait, what would that be in?
DETECTIVE: I'm wagering CURRENCY. But then again, my name is Lucky, both in good and bad. (exit through the door)
LADY: (scoffing) That explains a lot.

TEACHER: Okay class, today we're going to continue learning about GEOGRAPHY.
TEACHER: Now, yesterday we left off with how GEOGRAPHY was a result of CATASTROPHIC WORLD EVENT...
TEACHER: Everybody take out your calculators.
ALEX: You mean our ROCKS?
TEACHER: Yep, the ROCKS we use every day to calculate the answers to GEOGRAPHY problems.
SAMMY: But Mr. HAMSWORTHY, I left my ROCKS at home!
TEACHER: That's okay, Sammy, you can borrow my ROCKS. (Hand SAMMY ROCKS)
TEACHER: These ROCKS were passed down, generation after generation, starting with my great grandfather, Elder HAMSWORTHY the first.
ALEX: Mr. HAMSWORTHY, these ROCKS aren't very good at calculating things.
ALEX: My cousin goes to Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs, and they have advanced electronic ROCKS that can calculate GEOGRAPHY way easier.
SAMMY: Yeah, my hands hurt from operating this ancient old ROCKS. What's the point? We won't have to calculate GEOGRAPHY in the real world anyway.
TEACHER: Now students, first of all, you're missing the big picture.
TEACHER: You gotta learn the fundamentals. You can't just assume you can google the answers to your GEOGRAPHY problems.
TEACHER: My great grandfather HAMSWORTHY Senior Senior Senior the first started on ROCKS and that's what you'll do too.
TEACHER: Besides, you know our school doesn't have the kind of funding that Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs has.
TEACHER: Now, students, it's time for a pop GEOGRAPHY quiz.
ALEX: (Groan in disappointment) Awwww!
Meanwhile SAMMY: (Groan in disappointment) Awwww!
TEACHER: Listen closely. If Alice has 3 APPLES, and Bob has 5 APPLES, and Alice FOLDS THE LAUNDRY, how many APPLES does Bob have?
ALEX: (Starts fiddling with ROCKS) Hmm... 3 APPLES... carry the 1... the X APPLES cancels out the Y APPLES...
Meanwhile SAMMY: (Starts fiddling with ROCKS) Man, this is really hard. I'm struggling so much. I sure wish I studied instead of playing LEGO fortnite.
TEACHER: Alex, do you have the answer yet? It's a very simple question.
ALEX: Uhhh is it... NUMBER APPLES?
TEACHER: No, that's... incorrect.
ALEX: I think my ROCKS is not working properly.
SAMMY: (Raising hand) Oooh ooh! The answer is... 5!
TEACHER: That's right! You get a GOLD STAR! (Give SAMMY a GOLD STAR)
SAMMY: Yaaaaay!
TEACHER: See, Alex? With enough hard work and elbow grease, ROCKS is perfectly suited for complex GEOGRAPHY problems.
SAMMY: (Teasing ALEX) In your face you DELINQUENT!
TEACHER: (Noticing something suspicious under SAMMY) Wait a second.... is that....? What's that under your seat?
SAMMY: (Panicking, nervous) Oh, that? That's nothing...! Just my... other ROCKS!
TEACHER: (Retrieving item from under SAMMY) Is this a TI-84 CALCULATOR?
SAMMY: What???? How did that get there? That's crazy.
ALEX: That's no fair! One TI-84 CALCULATOR is about as powerful as ... (Typing on ROCKS) over 50 ROCKS!
TEACHER: Sammy, did you bring enough TI-84 CALCULATOR for the entire class?
SAMMY: (Sad) No....
TEACHER: I'm taking away your GOLD STAR. (Take GOLD STAR back from SAMMY)
SAMMY: Nooooo!
TEACHER: How much did this TI-84 CALCULATOR cost?
SAMMY: I don't know, I stole it from a kid who goes to Preppingsworth Academy for young DELINQUIENTs.
TEACHER: Well here's what I think about your new-fangled technology. (Smash TI-84 CALCULATOR on the floor)

CREATOR: (Enter the stage) Greetings, Investors!
CREATOR: I'm the CEO and Founder of COMPANY.
CREATOR: So, we have all been there, you ever just PROBLEM1, PROBLEM2, and many other problems you might have.
CREATOR: Does these problems annoy you so much you want to get rid of them?
INV1: Yeah, it really bothers me so much.
INV2: Yes.
CREATOR: If only there's someone who are helpful enough to fix these problems for you...
CREATOR: So here at COMPANY, we just found an innovative way and crafted the product that can help you live in peace knowing someone's with you.
CREATOR: Introducing… (Gesture toward the door, waiting)
PRODUCT: (Enter the stage and stand alongside CREATOR)
CREATOR: PRODNAME.
INV1: Wait... Isn't it just… a person?
CREATOR: Yes, it technically is.
CREATOR: But PRODNAME can do all the annoying problems solved for you in any way they can possibly think of.
INV2: Can I use it as a roommate?
CREATOR: Absolutely! You can do anything you want with PRODNAME. Anything.
INV1: But... can it speak just like any other avatar?
CREATOR: It does. (Look at PRODNAME) Hey, PRODNAME!
PRODUCT: PRODTALK
INV1: Oh, so it's technically a person then.
CREATOR: The secret behind is that PRODNAME uses machine learning technology powered by it's own processor, V1 chip…
CREATOR: …to do anything like FEATURES, etc.
PRODUCT: There are tons of other features I can do for you that I can't fit in this show.
INV2: Is it available for purchase yet?
CREATOR: Unfortunately, it's still in production, with deliveries planned in batches in the near future.
CREATOR: And, you can buy PRODNAME for a small price of PRICE.
shark tank discussion music 1
INV1: So, we have already found some flaws as you're talking about PRODNAME.
INV1: Is it actually designed for use in extreme activities, such as using it to work in a job and give you salary they earned?
CREATOR: We actually thought of that, and, because it's only designed for use at home, we made it so that none of these extreme activities will be worked with PRODNAME.
CREATOR: We also have a NUMBER-page safety instruction manual included if you buy one.
INV2: Can I use it as a mentor to teach my children?
CREATOR: If only it's your problem, then yes.
CREATOR: Keep in mind, PRODNAME can only solve YOUR problems for you, not someone else's problem. You can think of it as your personal roomate.
INV1: What if PRODNAME suddenly stops working?
CREATOR: That is why there's a 7 day battery life so you don't have to charge it often.
INV2: But I'm afraid the charging time would take hours since it has a big battery...
CREATOR: THAT is also why we managed to achieve charging time when charging to 80% to be less than 1 hour.
INV2: Looks like we have nothing else to doubt. I'm impressed you actually thought way beyond and created a product with all that in mind.
INV1: Yeah, I'm impressed too, you're a genius! Anyway, what do you ask for an investment?
CREATOR: We plan to roll out software updates and potentially an enhanced version of PRODNAME,
CREATOR: so we're looking for an investment of ASKMONEY dollars.

Meanwhile ARCH: (run in with the knight)
GUAR: (Startled out of chair) Wh-what’s going on!? Sir LACELOT ?!
Meanwhile KNIG: (Run to the locker in the corner) The King’s JEWEL you fool! The crown JEWEL! The very thing you’re guarding!
ARCH: A thief entered the castle! The lookout gave the alert!
GUAR: A thief!
KNIG: (Pull out the JEWEL from the locker) Oof… The JEWEL are safe.
ARCH: You were slacking off again, weren’t you
GUAR: Wha- pfff no! I was. I was inspecting the inside of my eyelids…
KNIG: (slap the guard on the back of the head) You twit! With your presence of mind that thief could steal the whole castle before you noticed!
Meanwhile GUAR: (The Knight hits you) Ouch!
WIZ: (appear in the doorframe) I’m afraid things are much worse that you say Sir LACELOT.
KNIG: Grand Wizard HARRY ! What brings you down from your tower!
WIZ: Are the JEWEL safe?
KNIG: Well, yes, but- Wait, what do you mean, much worse?
WIZ: The hour is dire. I was in the middle of concocting my new MAGIC1 potion.
WIZ: I was dosing the correct amount of RAT to add, when suddenly the lookout’s call startled me and I added too much.
WIZ: Upset, I decided I’d go give him a piece of my mind about yelling at such hours.

WIZ: A SHAPE ! A magical creature which can turn into anything, or anyone it pleases!
ARCH: (Look at the guard mockingly) Honestly, don't you know anything...
GUAR: Ooooh
WIZ: Indeed and every time a SHAPE changes, it leaves behind GREEN GOO !
WIZ: (examine the GOO ) which coincidentally could prove most useful for the development of a MAGIC2 potion.
WIZ: (To yourself) Maybe with an ounce of EYE and heated up a bit.
KNIG: (annoyed) Your point, Grand Wizard HARRY .
WIZ: My point!? (close the door, then look back at the others)
WIZ: Well tell me, Sir LACELOT ? Did you happen to see any SHAPE s?
KNIG: No?

WIZ: It could be anyone of us! It could be you! It could be me! It could be that chair! It could even be a magically levitating OBJECT for all we know!
Meanwhile GUAR: (make your way behind the wizard and raise your sword)
WIZ: (To yourself) Or maybe it’s waiting for us to turn on each other so it can steal the JEWEL unhindered?

TROLL: Troll had slow day today. Not many humans come to Troll's bridge anymore.
TROLL: Troll not even eaten any human BODYPART in weeks!
TROLL: Troll study to become JOB. Troll not even do that right. Troll always back to living under bridge. What Troll doing with life?
TROLL: (Sniff yourself) Yuck, Troll smell like SMELL! Troll need to clean.
TROLL: (Jump into the river facing the audience) Troll stay here until Troll not smell like SMELL anymore.
BELIEVER: (Enter stage right) Okay, so I got Amy to set the cameras up already, so we should be good to go. Oh, is your body camera on?
Meanwhile SKEPTIC: (Follow believer through stage right)
SKEPTIC: Yeah yeah, it's not like we're going to find anything, we never do.
BELIEVER: Shush! Let's be professional. Three, two, one...
Scary music
BELIEVER: (Look to the audience) Welcome back to SHOW, the best supernatural investigation show in the business!
BELIEVER: Last week we caught a CREATURE on camera at the nearby BUILDING!
SKEPTIC: Well, that's debatable...
BELIEVER: (Ignore skeptic) Anyway, this week we're deep in the forests of PLACE, hunting for the mysterious Troll said to lurk around this very bridge.
BELIEVER: They say this creature is known for its fierce teeth, gigantic stature, and the stench of SMELL!
Thunder
SKEPTIC: I mean, trolls don't exist, but this bridge does really stink of SMELL.
TROLL: (Climb back onto the bridge and face the investigators) Hey! That not nice. Troll wash self in river. Troll not smell like SMELL anymore!
BELIEVER: (Step back in awe at the sigh of the Troll) It can't be! Is that... The Troll of PLACE?!
SKEPTIC: Oh please, it's clearly just a really big ANIMAL.
Silly music 2
BELIEVER: (Point at skeptic) You always do this. You always try to explain everything away. What about the CREATURE we caught on camera last week at the BUILDING?
SKEPTIC: That CREATURE was NAME!
SKEPTIC: They just accidentally fell into some SUBSTANCE then rolled around in trash trying to get it off.
SKEPTIC: Then started to scream WEIRDTHING at the top of their lungs.
SKEPTIC: Sure it's weird, but it doesn't make them a CREATURE.
BELIEVER: Was it really NAME though? I don't buy it. Screaming WEIRDTHING is something that only a CREATURE would do!
BELIEVER: And it's known that trolls smell like SMELL, therefore this is a genuine troll! And it talks too!
SKEPTIC: Okay, listen, sure this ANIMAL talks, but think about it, parrots can talk, so it's not that much of a leap to say that a big ANIMAL could talk too.
SKEPTIC: And hey, maybe it'll scream WEIRDTHING too, who knows? But it's not a troll.
TROLL: Humans make too much noise. Make Troll's head hurt. Why you bother troll?
BELIEVER: (Excitedly talk to the Troll) Well, we're filming for our show, SHOW, we seek out supernatural creatures, much like yourself!
BELIEVER: So tell me, how long have you lived in the forests of PLACE?
TROLL: Well, Troll study to be JOB, but Troll no find work. No-one want to hire Troll.
TROLL: They say Troll smells too much like SMELL.
BELIEVER: Well, that's because you're a troll, right? Don't you all smell like that?
TROLL: No! Troll normally smell fine, not like SMELL at all!
SKEPTIC: For the record, I think you only smell that way because you're clearly a ANIMAL.
TROLL: (Frustrated) Why you call Troll ANIMAL? Humans are rude! Troll no do interview. Troll want to sit in river, not answer questions.
BELIEVER: Look what you did! You blew a perfect opportunity to learn more about the supernatural! I hope you're happy with yourself.
SKEPTIC: (Approach the Troll) Look, I didn't mean any disrespect, maybe I came off a bit harsh. I'm just tired is all.
SKEPTIC: I'm sure you'd make a great JOB, after a bit of a clean that is.
TROLL: Human really mean it?
SKEPTIC: Yeah, of course! And it's better to be a JOB than to do what we do.
SKEPTIC: My friend here drags me out to do these supernatural 'hunts' with him, it's always something completely explainable though.
TROLL: Wait. Humans want to hunt Troll? Troll easily crush humans!
TROLL: (Move toward the investigators aggressively) Troll crush humans right now, then eat human's BODYPART!
BELIEVER: (Step back in horror) No, not my BODYPART!
BELIEVER: (Run away through stage right) Quickly, let's get out of here! And make sure you bring all of the footage!
SKEPTIC: (Give the troll a can a deodorant) Hey man, I know you're not a troll, but you smell like one. Try this on, it's ANYTHING scented deodorant.
TROLL: (Take the deodorant, confused)
SKEPTIC: Anyway, I better go keep an eye on him in case he has another 'accident', he usually does when he's scared. (Exit stage right)
TROLL: (Sniff the deodorant) This ANYTHING deodorant smell bad, like human! Troll would rather smell like SMELL than like human!

CLERK 1: It's only HOUR more hours, dude.
CLERK 2: HOUR more hours? HOUR more hours, I can't wait that long man.
CLERK 1: Dude, want some candy?
CLERK 2: Eh, no thanks.
CLERK 1: Dude, come on. It's HOLIDAY. You gotta have candy on HOLIDAY.
CLERK 2: Okay fine, just give me one.
CLERK 1: Ha ha, yeah let's go (hands other clerk candy)
CLERK 2: (chews candy and thinks) Hey I think there's something wrong with this candy.
CLERK 1: What do you mean? What's wrong with it?
CLERK 2: I don't know, it tastes kinda funny.
CLERK 1: Hmm? Oh yeah, it's probably because of the drugs I put in it.
CLERK 2: What? Why would you do that, what's wrong with you?
CLERK 1: Oh jeez, sorry I-I thought it would be fun.
CLERK 2: Well you thought wrong, I mean what did you put in these things anyway?
CLERK 1: It's just a little WEED
CLERK 2: WEED candy. You put WEED in a candy bar.
CLERK 1: (thinks) Oh wait, I didn't put any WEED in this candy. It was ACID!
CLERK 2: (spits out candy) ACID?! What the hell is wrong with you?
CLERK 1: I'm sorry, I'm sorry
CLERK 2: You say that like ACID is safer than WEED. You know it's not, right?
CLERK 1: I'm sorry, but what's done is done. My advice, just stay calm and let it ride out.
CLERK 2: Fine, I guess you're right. When do you suppose it will kick in?

CUSTOMER: Do you have any POTATO? This is STORE is it not?
CLERK 1: (Trying to act casual) Yeah man, this is STORE.
CLERK 2: (whisper to clerk) What's going on?
CLERK 1: (whisper to clerk) Just go with it.
CUSTOMER: Excuse me! I don't have all night, it is HOLIDAY after all and I'm a very busy ALIEN
CLERK 1: Yeah dude, I think we have some in the back. Follow me
CUSTOMER: Thank you, I thought I'd never find any POTATO this time of night. (follow clerk towards stage left)
Meanwhile CLERK 1: (walk customer towards stage left)
CLERK 2: Oh man. What am I gonna do? I can't help any customers like this.
CLERK 2: You know what, he's right. I just gotta stay calm and let it ride out.
CLERK 2: Everything will be fine, what's the worst that could happen?
